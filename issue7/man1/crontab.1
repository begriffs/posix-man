.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
crontab \fB[\fIfile\fB]\fR
.P
crontab \fB[\fR\(mie\||\(mil|\(mir\fB]\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR crontab
utility shall create, replace,
or edit a user's crontab entry;
a crontab entry is a list of commands and the times at which they
shall be executed. The new crontab entry can be input by specifying
.IR file
or input from standard input if no
.IR file
operand is specified,
or by using an editor, if
.BR \(mie
is specified.
.P
Upon execution of a command from a crontab entry, the implementation
shall supply a default environment, defining at least the following
environment variables:
.IP "\fIHOME\fP" 10
A pathname of the user's home directory.
.IP "\fILOGNAME\fP" 10
The user's login name.
.IP "\fIPATH\fP" 10
A string representing a search path guaranteed to find all of the
standard utilities.
.IP "\fISHELL\fP" 10
A pathname of the command interpreter. When
.IR crontab
is invoked as specified by this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008, the value shall be a pathname for
.IR sh .
.P
The values of these variables when
.IR crontab
is invoked as specified by this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 shall not affect the default
values provided when the scheduled command is run.
.P
If standard output and standard error are not redirected by commands
executed from the crontab entry, any generated output or errors shall
be mailed, via an implementation-defined method, to the user.
.P
Users shall be permitted to use
.IR crontab
if their names appear in the file
.BR cron.allow
which is located in an implementation-defined directory.
If that file does not exist, the file
.BR cron.deny ,
which is located in an implementation-defined directory,
shall be checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access to
.IR crontab .
If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate privileges shall be
allowed to submit a job. If only
.BR cron.deny
exists and is empty, global usage shall be permitted. The
.BR cron.allow
and
.BR cron.deny
files shall consist of one user name per line.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.IR crontab
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 12.2" ", " "Utility Syntax Guidelines".
.P
The following options shall be supported:
.IP "\fB\(mie\fP" 10
Edit a copy of the invoking user's crontab entry, or create an empty
entry to edit if the crontab entry does not exist. When editing is
complete, the entry shall be installed as the user's crontab entry.
.IP "\fB\(mil\fP" 10
(The letter ell.) List the invoking user's crontab entry.
.IP "\fB\(mir\fP" 10
Remove the invoking user's crontab entry.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
.IP "\fIfile\fR" 10
The pathname of a file that contains specifications, in the format
defined in the INPUT FILES section, for crontab entries.
.SH STDIN
See the INPUT FILES section.
.SH "INPUT FILES"
In the POSIX locale, the user or application shall ensure that a
crontab entry is a text file consisting of lines of six fields each.
The fields shall be separated by
<blank>
characters. The first five fields shall be integer patterns that specify
the following:
.IP " 1." 4
Minute [0,59]
.IP " 2." 4
Hour [0,23]
.IP " 3." 4
Day of the month [1,31]
.IP " 4." 4
Month of the year [1,12]
.IP " 5." 4
Day of the week ([0,6] with 0=Sunday)
.P
Each of these patterns can be either an
<asterisk>
(meaning all valid values), an element, or a list of elements separated by
<comma>
characters. An element shall be either a number or two numbers separated
by a
<hyphen>
(meaning an inclusive range). The specification of days can be made by
two fields (day of the month and day of the week). If month, day of
month, and day of week are all
<asterisk>
characters, every day shall be matched. If either the month or day of
month is specified as an element or list, but the day of week is an
<asterisk>,
the month and day of month fields shall specify the days that match. If
both month and day of month are specified as an
<asterisk>,
but day of week is an element or list, then only the specified days of the
week match. Finally, if either the month or day of month is specified as
an element or list, and the day of week is also specified as an element
or list, then any day matching either the month and day of month, or
the day of week, shall be matched.
.P
The sixth field of a line in a crontab entry is a string that shall be
executed by
.IR sh
at the specified times. A
<percent-sign>
character in this field shall be translated to a
<newline>.
Any character preceded by a
<backslash>
(including the
.BR '%' )
shall cause that character to be treated literally. Only the first line
(up to a
.BR '%' 
or end-of-line) of the command field shall be executed by the command
interpreter. The other lines shall be made available to the command as
standard input.
.P
Blank lines and those whose first non-\c
<blank>
is
.BR '#' 
shall be ignored.
.P
The text files
.BR cron.allow
and
.BR cron.deny ,
which are located in an implementation-defined directory,
shall contain zero or more user names, one per line, of users who are,
respectively, authorized or denied access to the service underlying the
.IR crontab
utility.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
.IR crontab :
.IP "\fIEDITOR\fP" 10
Determine the editor to be invoked when the
.BR \(mie
option is specified. The default editor shall be
.IR vi .
.IP "\fILANG\fP" 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 8.2" ", " "Internationalization Variables"
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.IP "\fILC_ALL\fP" 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.IP "\fILC_CTYPE\fP" 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
.IP "\fILC_MESSAGES\fP" 10
.br
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
.IP "\fINLSPATH\fP" 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
.IR LC_MESSAGES .
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
Default.
.SH STDOUT
If the
.BR \(mil
option is specified, the crontab entry shall be written to the standard
output.
.SH STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
None.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values shall be returned:
.IP "\00" 6
Successful completion.
.IP >0 6
An error occurred.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
The user's crontab entry is not submitted, removed,
edited,
or listed.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The format of the crontab entry shown here is guaranteed only for the
POSIX locale. Other cultures may be supported with substantially
different interfaces, although implementations are encouraged to
provide comparable levels of functionality.
.P
The default settings of the
.IR HOME ,
.IR LOGNAME ,
.IR PATH ,
and
.IR SHELL
variables that are given to the scheduled job are not affected by the
settings of those variables when
.IR crontab
is run; as stated, they are defaults. The text about ``invoked as
specified by this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008'' means that the implementation may provide
extensions that allow these variables to be affected at runtime, but
that the user has to take explicit action in order to access the
extension, such as give a new option flag or modify the format of the
crontab entry.
.P
A typical user error is to type only
.IR crontab ;
this causes the system to wait for the new crontab entry on standard
input. If end-of-file is typed (generally <control>\(hyD), the crontab
entry is replaced by an empty file. In this case, the user should type
the interrupt character, which prevents the crontab entry from being
replaced.
.SH EXAMPLES

.RS 4
.nf
\fB
0 12 14 2 * mailx john%Happy Birthday!%Time for lunch.
.fi \fR
.P
.RE

.IP " 3." 4
As an example of specifying the two types of days:
.RS 4 
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
0 0 1,15 * 1
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
would run a command on the first and fifteenth of each month, as well
as on every Monday. To specify days by only one field, the other field
should be set to
.BR '*' ;
for example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
0 0 * * 1
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
would run a command only on Mondays.
.RE
.SH RATIONALE
All references to a
.IR cron
daemon and to
.IR cron
.IR files
have been omitted. Although historical implementations have used this
arrangement, there is no reason to limit future implementations.
.P
This description of
.IR crontab
is designed to support only users with normal privileges. The format of
the input is based on the System V
.IR crontab ;
however, there is no requirement here that the actual system database
used by the
.IR cron
daemon (or a similar mechanism) use this format internally. For
example, systems derived from BSD are likely to have an additional
field appended that indicates the user identity to be used when the job
is submitted.
.P
The
.BR \(mie
option was adopted from the SVID as a user convenience, although it
does not exist in all historical implementations.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
