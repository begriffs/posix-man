.SH NAME
break
\(em exit from for, while, or until loop
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
break \fB[\fIn\fB]\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR break
utility shall exit from the smallest enclosing
.BR for ,
.BR while ,
or
.BR until
loop, if any; or from the
.IR n th
enclosing loop if
.IR n
is specified. The value of
.IR n
is an unsigned decimal integer greater than or equal to 1. The default
shall be equivalent to
.IR n =1.
If
.IR n
is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing
loop shall be exited. Execution shall continue with the command
immediately following the loop.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH OPERANDS
See the DESCRIPTION.
.SH STDIN
Not used.
.SH "INPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
None.
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
Default.
.SH STDOUT
Not used.
.SH STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
None.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IP "\00" 6
Successful completion.
.IP >0 6
The
.IR n
value was not an unsigned decimal integer greater than or equal to 1.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
Default.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
.nf
for i in *
do
    if test \(mid "$i"
    then break
    fi
done
.fi
.SH "RATIONALE"
In early proposals, consideration was given to expanding the syntax of
.IR break
and
.IR continue
to refer to a label associated with the appropriate loop as a
preferable alternative to the
.IR n
method. However, this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 does reserve the name space of command names
ending with a
<colon>.
It is anticipated that a future implementation could take advantage of
this and provide something like:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
outofloop: for i in a b c d e
do
    for j in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    do
        if test \(mir "${i}${j}"
        then break outofloop
        fi
    done
done
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
and that this might be standardized after implementation experience is
achieved.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
