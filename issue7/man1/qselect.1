.SH DESCRIPTION
To select a set of batch jobs is to return the batch
.IR job_identifier s
for each batch job that meets a list of selection criteria. A set of
batch jobs is selected by a request to a batch server. The
.IR qselect
utility is a user-accessible batch client that requests the selection
of batch jobs.
.P
Upon successful completion, the
.IR qselect
utility shall have returned a list of zero or more batch
.IR job_identifier s
that meet the criteria specified by the options and option-arguments
presented to the utility.
.P
The
.IR qselect
utility shall select batch jobs by sending a
.IR "Select Jobs Request"
to a batch server. The
.IR qselect
utility shall not exit until the server replies to each request
generated.
.P
For each option presented to the
.IR qselect
utility, the utility shall restrict the set of selected batch jobs as
described in the OPTIONS section.
.P
The
.IR qselect
utility shall not restrict selection of batch jobs except by
authorization and as required by the options presented to the utility.
.P
When an option is specified with a mandatory or optional
.IR op
component to the option-argument, then
.IR op
shall specify a relation between the value of a certain batch job
attribute and the
.IR value
component of the option-argument. If an
.IR op
is allowable on an option, then the description of the option letter
indicates the
.IR op
as either mandatory or optional. Acceptable strings for the
.IR op
component, and the relation the string indicates, are shown in the
following list:
.IP "\fR.eq.\fR" 8
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is equal to the
value represented by the option-argument.
.IP "\fR.ge.\fR" 8
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is greater than
or equal to the value represented by the option-argument.
.IP "\fR.gt.\fR" 8
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is greater than
the value represented by the option-argument.
.IP "\fR.lt.\fR" 8
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is less than
the value represented by the option-argument.
.IP "\fR.le.\fR" 8
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is less than or
equal to the value represented by the option-argument.
.IP "\fR.ne.\fR" 8
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is not equal to
the value represented by the option-argument.

.IR hold_list
option-argument that is a string of alphanumeric characters in the
portable character set (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,

.SH RATIONALE
The
.IR qselect
utility allows users to acquire a list of job identifiers that match
user-specified selection criteria. The list of identifiers returned by
the
.IR qselect
utility conforms to the syntax of the batch job identifier list
processed by a utility such as
.IR qmove ,
.IR qdel ,
and
.IR qrls .
The
.IR qselect
utility is thus a powerful tool for causing another batch system
utility to act upon a set of jobs that match a list of selection
criteria.
.P
The options of the
.IR qselect
utility let the user apply a number of useful filters for selecting
jobs. Each option further restricts the selection of jobs. Many of the
selection options allow the specification of a relational operator. The
FORTRAN-like syntax of the operator\(emthat is,
.BR \(dq.lt.\(dq \(em\c
was chosen rather than the C-like
.BR \(dq<=\(dq 
meta-characters.
.P
The
.BR \(mia
option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to those that have
been submitted (or altered) to wait until a particular time. The time
period is determined by the argument of this option, which includes
both a time and an operator\(emit is thus possible to select jobs
waiting until a specific time, jobs waiting until after a certain time,
or those waiting for a time before the specified time.
.P
The
.BR \(miA
option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to those that have
been submitted (or altered) to charge a particular account.
.P
The
.BR \(mic
option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to those whose
checkpointing interval falls within the specified range.
.P
The
.BR \(mil
option allows users to select those jobs whose resource limits fall
within the range indicated by the value of the option. For example, a
user could select those jobs for which the CPU time limit is greater
than two hours.
.P
The
.BR \(miN
option allows users to select jobs by job name. For instance, all the
parts of a task that have been divided in parallel jobs might be given
the same name, and thus manipulated as a group by means of this
option.
.P
The
.BR \(miq
option allows users to select jobs in a specified queue.
.P
The
.BR \(mir
option allows users to select only those jobs with a specified rerun
criteria. For instance, a user might select only those jobs that can be
rerun for use with the
.IR qrerun
utility.
.P
The
.BR \(mis
option allows users to select only those jobs that are in a certain
state.
.P
The
.BR \(miu
option allows users to select jobs that have been submitted to execute
under a particular account.
.P
The selection criteria provided by the options of the
.IR qselect
utility allow users to select jobs based on all the appropriate
attributes that can be assigned to jobs by the
.IR qsub
utility.
.P
Historically, the
.IR qselect
utility has not been a part of existing practice; it is an improvement
that has been introduced in this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008.
