.SH NAME

\(em set the export attribute for variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
export name\fB[\fR=\fIword\fB]\fR...
.P
export\fR \(mip
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The shell shall give the
.IR export
attribute to the variables corresponding to the specified
.IR name s,
which shall cause them to be in the environment of subsequently
executed commands. If the name of a variable is followed by =\c
.IR word ,
then the value of that variable shall be set to
.IR word .
.P
The
.IR export
special built-in shall support the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 12.2" ", " "Utility Syntax Guidelines".
.P
When
.BR \(mip
is specified,
.IR export
shall write to the standard output the names and values of all exported
variables, in the following format:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
"export %s=%s\en", <\fIname\fR>, <\fIvalue\fR>
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
if
.IR name
is set, and:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
"export %s\en", <\fIname\fR>
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
if
.IR name
is unset.
.P
The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of quoting,
so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands that
achieve the same exporting results, except:
.IP " 1." 4
Read-only variables with values cannot be reset.
.IP " 2." 4
Variables that were unset at the time they were output need not be
reset to the unset state if a value is assigned to the variable between
the time the state was saved and the time at which the saved output is
reinput to the shell.
.P
When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified. If a variable
assignment precedes the command name of
.IR export
but that variable is not also listed as an operand of
.IR export ,
then that variable shall be set in the current shell execution environment
after the completion of the
.IR export
command, but it is unspecified whether that variable is marked for export.

.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.SH "RATIONALE"
Some historical shells use the no-argument case as the functional
equivalent of what is required here with
.BR \(mip .
This feature was left unspecified because it is not historical practice
in all shells, and some scripts may rely on the now-unspecified results
on their implementations. Attempts to specify the
.BR \(mip
output as the default case were unsuccessful in achieving consensus.
The
.BR \(mip
option was added to allow portable access to the values that can be
saved and then later restored using; for example, a
.IR dot
script.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
