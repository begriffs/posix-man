.SH NAME
sact
\(em print current SCCS file-editing activity (\fBDEVELOPMENT\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
sact \fIfile\fR...
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR sact
utility shall inform the user of any impending deltas to a named SCCS
file by writing a list to standard output. This situation occurs when
.IR get
.BR \(mie
has been executed previously without a subsequent execution of
.IR delta ,
.IR unget ,
or
.IR sccs
.BR unedit .
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
.IP "\fIfile\fR" 10
A pathname of an existing SCCS file or a directory. If
.IR file
is a directory, the
.IR sact
utility shall behave as though each file in the directory were
specified as a named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component
of the pathname does not begin with
.BR s. )
and unreadable files shall be silently ignored.
.RS 10 
.P
If exactly one
.IR file
operand appears, and it is
.BR '\(mi' ,
the standard input shall be read; each line of the standard input shall
be taken to be the name of an SCCS file to be processed. Non-SCCS files
and unreadable files shall be silently ignored.
.RE
.SH STDIN
The standard input shall be a text file used only when the
.IR file
operand is specified as
.BR '\(mi' .
Each line of the text file shall be interpreted as an SCCS pathname.
.SH "INPUT FILES"
Any SCCS files interrogated are files of an unspecified format.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
.IR sact :
.IP "\fILANG\fP" 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 8.2" ", " "Internationalization Variables"
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.IP "\fILC_ALL\fP" 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.IP "\fILC_CTYPE\fP" 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
.IP "\fILC_MESSAGES\fP" 10
.br
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
.IP "\fINLSPATH\fP" 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
.IR LC_MESSAGES .
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
Default.
.SH STDOUT
The output for each named file shall consist of a line in the following
format:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
"%s %s %s %s %s\en", <\fISID\fR>, <\fInew SID\fR>, <\fIlogin\fR>, <\fIdate\fR>, <\fItime\fR>
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.IP "<\fISID\fR>" 10
Specifies the SID of a delta that currently exists in the SCCS file to
which changes are made to make the new delta.
.IP "<\fInew\ SID\fR>" 10
Specifies the SID for the new delta to be created.
.IP "<\fIlogin\fR>" 10
Contains the login name of the user who makes the delta (that is, who
executed a
.IR get
for editing).
.IP "<\fIdate\fR>" 10
Contains the date that
.IR get
.BR \(mie
was executed, in the format used by the
.IR prs
.BR :D:
data keyword.
.IP "<\fItime\fR>" 10
Contains the time that
.IR get
.BR \(mie
was executed, in the format used by the
.IR prs
.BR :T:
data keyword.
.P
If there is more than one named file or if a directory or standard
input is named, each pathname shall be written before each of the
preceding lines:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
"\en%s:\en", <\fIpathname\fR>
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.SH STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for optional informative
messages concerning SCCS files with no impending deltas, and for
diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
None.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values shall be returned:
.IP "\00" 6
Successful completion.
.IP >0 6
An error occurred.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
Default.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
