.SH DESCRIPTION
To submit a script is to create a batch job that executes the script. A
script is submitted by a request to a batch server. The
.IR qsub
utility is a user-accessible batch client that submits a script.
.P
Upon successful completion, the
.IR qsub
utility shall have created a batch job that will execute the submitted
script.
.P
The
.IR qsub
utility shall submit a script by sending a
.IR "Queue Job Request"
to a batch server.
.P
The
.IR qsub
utility shall place the value of the following environment variables in
the
.IR Variable_List
attribute of the batch job:
.IR HOME ,
.IR LANG ,
.IR LOGNAME ,
.IR PATH ,
.IR MAIL ,
.IR SHELL ,
and
.IR TZ .
The name of the environment variable shall be the current name prefixed
with the string PBS_O_.
.TP 10
.BR Note:
If the current value of the
.IR HOME
variable in the environment space of the
.IR qsub
utility is
.BR /aa/bb/cc ,
then
.IR qsub
shall place
.IR PBS_O_HOME =\c
.BR /aa/bb/cc
in the
.IR Variable_List
attribute of the batch job.
.P
.P
In addition to the variables described above, the
.IR qsub
utility shall add the following variables with the indicated values to
the variable list:
.IP "\fIPBS_O_WORKDIR\fP" 14
The absolute path of the current working directory of the
.IR qsub
utility process.
.IP "\fIPBS_O_HOST\fP" 14
The name of the host on which the
.IR qsub
utility is running.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.IR qsub
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 12.2" ", " "Utility Syntax Guidelines".
.P
The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
.IP "\fB\(mia\ \fIdate_time\fR" 10

.P
.P
The
.IR qsub
utility shall set the
.IR Execution_Time
attribute of the batch job to the number of seconds since the Epoch
that is equivalent to the local time expressed by the value of the
.IR date_time
option-argument. The Epoch is defined in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 3.150" ", " "Epoch".
.P

.SH OPERANDS
The
.IR qsub
utility shall accept a
.IR script
operand that indicates the path to the script of the batch job.
.P
If the
.IR script
operand is not presented to the
.IR qsub
utility, or if the operand is the single-character string
.BR '\(mi' ,
the utility shall read the script from standard input.
.P
If the script represents a partial path, the
.IR qsub
utility shall expand the path relative to the current directory of the
process executing the utility.
.SH STDIN
The
.IR qsub
utility reads the script of the batch job from standard input if the
script operand is omitted or is the single character
.BR '\(mi' .
.SH "INPUT FILES"
In addition to binding the file indicated by the
.IR script
operand to the batch job, the
.IR qsub
utility reads the script file and acts on directives in the script.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
.IR qsub :
.IP "\fILANG\fP" 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 8.2" ", " "Internationalization Variables"
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the
values of locale categories.)
.IP "\fILC_ALL\fP" 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.IP "\fILC_CTYPE\fP" 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
.IP "\fILC_MESSAGES\fP" 10
.br
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
.IP "\fILOGNAME\fP" 10
Determine the login name of the user.
.IP "\fIPBS_DPREFIX\fP" 10
.br
Determine the default prefix for directives within the script.
.IP "\fISHELL\fP" 10
Determine the pathname of the preferred command language interpreter
of the user.
.IP "\fITZ\fP" 10
Determine the timezone used to interpret the
.IR date-time
option-argument. If
.IR TZ
is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
Once created, a batch job exists until it exits, aborts, or is
deleted.
.P
After a batch job is created by the
.IR qsub
utility, batch servers might route, execute, modify, or delete the
batch job.
.SH STDOUT
The
.IR qsub
utility writes the batch
.IR job_identifier
assigned to the batch job to standard output, unless the
.BR \(miz
option is specified.
.SH STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
.SS "Script Preservation"
.P
The
.IR qsub
utility shall make the script available to the server executing the
batch job in such a way that the server executes the script as it
exists at the time of submission.
.P
The
.IR qsub
utility can send a copy of the script to the server with the
.IR "Queue Job Request"
or store a temporary copy of the script in a location specified to the
server.
.SS "Option Specification"
.P
A script can contain directives to the
.IR qsub
utility.
.P
The
.IR qsub
utility shall scan the lines of the script for directives, skipping
blank lines, until the first line that begins with a string other than
the directive string; if directives occur on subsequent lines, the
utility shall ignore those directives.
.P
Lines are separated by a
<newline>.
If the first line of the script begins with
.BR \(dq#!\(dq 
or a
<colon>
(\c
.BR ':' ),
then it is skipped. The
.IR qsub
utility shall process a line in the script as a directive if and only
if the string of characters from the first non-white-space character on
the line until the first
<space>
or
<tab>
on the line match the directive prefix. If a line in the script
contains a directive and the final characters of the line are
<backslash>
and
<newline>,
then the next line shall be interpreted as a continuation of that
directive.
.P
The
.IR qsub
utility shall process the options and option-arguments contained on the
directive prefix line using the same syntax as if the options were
input on the
.IR qsub
utility.
.P
The
.IR qsub
utility shall continue to process a directive prefix line until after a
<newline>
is encountered. An implementation may ignore lines which, according to
the syntax of the shell that will interpret the script, are comments.
An implementation shall describe in the conformance document the format
of any shell comments that it will recognize.
.P
If an option is present in both a directive and the arguments to the
.IR qsub
utility, the utility shall ignore the option and the corresponding
option-argument, if any, in the directive.
.P
If an option that is present in the directive is not present in the
arguments to the
.IR qsub
utility, the utility shall process the option and the option-argument,
if any.
.P
In order of preference, the
.IR qsub
utility shall select the directive prefix from one of the following
sources:
.IP " *" 4
If the
.BR \(miC
option is presented to the utility, the value of the
.IR directive_prefix
option-argument
.IP " *" 4
If the environment variable
.IR PBS_DPREFIX
is defined, the value of that variable
.IP " *" 4
The four-character string
.BR \(dq#PBS\(dq 
encoded in the portable character set
.P
If the
.BR \(miC
option is present in the script file it shall be ignored.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values shall be returned:
.IP "\00" 6
Successful completion.
.IP >0 6
An error occurred.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
Default.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH RATIONALE
The
.IR qsub
utility allows users to create a batch job that will process the script
specified as the operand of the utility.
.P
The options of the
.IR qsub
utility allow users to control many aspects of the queuing and
execution of a batch job.
.P
The
.BR \(mia
option allows users to designate the time after which the batch job
will become eligible to run. By specifying an execution time, users can
take advantage of resources at off-peak hours, synchronize jobs with
chronologically predictable events, and perhaps take advantage of
off-peak pricing of computing time. For these reasons and others, a
timing option is existing practice on the part of almost every batch
system, including NQS.
.P
The
.BR \(miA
option allows users to specify the account that will be charged for the
batch job. Support for account is not mandatory for conforming batch
servers.
.P
The
.BR \(miC
option allows users to prescribe the prefix for directives within the
script file. The default prefix
.BR \(dq#PBS\(dq 
may be inappropriate if the script will be interpreted with an
alternate shell, as specified by the
.BR \(miS
option.
.P
The
.BR \(mic
option allows users to establish the checkpointing interval for their
jobs. A checkpointing system, which is not defined by this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008, allows
recovery of a batch job at the most recent checkpoint in the event of a
crash. Checkpointing is typically used for jobs that consume expensive
computing time or must meet a critical schedule. Users should be
allowed to make the tradeoff between the overhead of checkpointing and
the risk to the timely completion of the batch job; therefore, this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008
provides the checkpointing interval option. Support for checkpointing
is optional for batch servers.
.P
The
.BR \(mie
option allows users to redirect the standard error streams of their
jobs to a non-default path. For example, if the submitted script
generally produces a great deal of useless error output, a user might
redirect the standard error output to the null device. Or, if the file
system holding the default location (the home directory of the user)
has too little free space, the user might redirect the standard error
stream to a file in another file system.
.P
The
.BR \(mih
option allows users to create a batch job that is held until explicitly
released. The ability to create a held job is useful when some external
event must complete before the batch job can execute. For example, the
user might submit a held job and release it when the system load has
dropped.
.P
The
.BR \(mij
option allows users to merge the standard error of a batch job into its
standard output stream, which has the advantage of showing the
sequential relationship between output and error messages.
.P
The
.BR \(mim
option allows users to designate those points in the execution of a
batch job at which mail will be sent to the submitting user, or to the
account(s) indicated by the
.BR \(miM
option. By requesting mail notification at points of interest in the
life of a job, the submitting user, or other designated users, can
track the progress of a batch job.
.P
The
.BR \(miN
option allows users to associate a name with the batch job. The job
name in no way affects the processing of the batch job, but rather
serves as a mnemonic handle for users. For example, the batch job name
can help the user distinguish between multiple jobs listed by the
.IR qstat
utility.
.P
The
.BR \(mio
option allows users to redirect the standard output stream. A user
might, for example, wish to redirect to the null device the standard
output stream of a job that produces copious yet superfluous output.
.P
The
.BR \(miP
option allows users to designate the relative priority of a batch job
for selection from a queue.
.P
The
.BR \(miq
option allows users to specify an initial queue for the batch job. If
the user specifies a routing queue, the batch server routes the
batch job to another queue for execution or further routing. If the
user specifies a non-routing queue, the batch server of the queue
eventually executes the batch job.
.P
The
.BR \(mir
option allows users to control whether the submitted job will be rerun
if the controlling batch node fails during execution of the batch job.
The
.BR \(mir
option likewise allows users to indicate whether or not the batch job
is eligible to be rerun by the
.IR qrerun
utility. Some jobs cannot be correctly rerun because of changes they
make in the state of databases or other aspects of their environment.
This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 specifies that the default, if the
.BR \(mir
option is not presented to the utility, will be that the batch job
cannot be rerun, since the result of rerunning a non-rerunnable job
might be catastrophic.
.P
The
.BR \(miS
option allows users to specify the program (usually a shell) that will
be invoked to process the script of the batch job. This option has been
modified to allow a list of shell names and locations associated with
different hosts.
.P
The
.BR \(miu
option is useful when the submitting user is authorized to use more
than one account on a given host, in which case the
.BR \(miu
option allows the user to select from among those accounts. The
option-argument is a list of user-host pairs, so that the submitting
user can provide different user identifiers for different nodes in the
event the batch job is routed. The
.BR \(miu
option provides a lot of flexibility to accommodate sites with complex
account structures. Users that have the same user identifier on all the
hosts they are authorized to use will not need to use the
.BR \(miu
option.
.P
The
.BR \(miV
option allows users to export all their current environment variables,
as of the time the batch job is submitted, to the context of the
processes of the batch job.
.P
The
.BR \(miv
option allows users to export specific environment variables from their
current process to the processes of the batch job.
.P
The
.BR \(miz
option allows users to suppress the writing of the batch job identifier
to standard output. The
.BR \(miz
option is an existing NQS practice that has been standardized.
.P
Historically, the
.IR qsub
utility has served the batch job-submission function in the NQS system,
the existing practice on which it is based. Some changes and additions
have been made to the
.IR qsub
utility in this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008, \fIvis-a-vis\fP NQS, as a result of the growing pool
of experience with distributed batch systems.
.P
The set of features of the
.IR qsub
utility as defined in this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 appears to incorporate all the common
existing practice on potentially conforming platforms.

utility may be removed in a future version.
