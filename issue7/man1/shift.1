.SH DESCRIPTION
The positional parameters shall be shifted. Positional parameter 1
shall be assigned the value of parameter (1+\fIn\fP), parameter 2 shall
be assigned the value of parameter (2+\fIn\fP), and so on. The
parameters represented by the numbers
.BR \(dq$#\(dq 
down to
.BR \(dq$#\(min+1\(dq 
shall be unset, and the parameter
.BR '#' 
is updated to reflect the new number of positional parameters.
.P
The value
.IR n
shall be an unsigned decimal integer less than or equal to the value of
the special parameter
.BR '#' .
If
.IR n
is not given, it shall be assumed to be 1. If
.IR n
is 0, the positional and special parameters are not changed.
