.SH DESCRIPTION
The attributes of a batch job are altered by a request to the batch
server that manages the batch job. The
.IR qalter
utility is a user-accessible batch client that requests the alteration
of the attributes of one or more batch jobs.
.P
The
.IR qalter
utility shall alter the attributes of those batch jobs, and only those
batch jobs, for which a batch
.IR job_identifier
is presented to the utility.
.P
The
.IR qalter
utility shall alter the attributes of batch jobs in the order in which
the batch
.IR job_identifier s
are presented to the utility.
.P
If the
.IR qalter
utility fails to process a batch
.IR job_identifier
successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining batch
.IR job_identifier s,
if any.
.P
For each batch
.IR job_identifier
for which the
.IR qalter
utility succeeds, each attribute of the identified batch job shall be
altered as indicated by all the options presented to the utility.
.P
For each identified batch job for which the
.IR qalter
utility fails, the utility shall not alter any attribute of the batch
job.
.P
For each batch job that the
.IR qalter
utility processes, the utility shall not modify any attribute other
than those required by the options and option-arguments presented to
the utility.
.P
The
.IR qalter
utility shall alter batch jobs by sending a
.IR "Modify Job Request"
to the batch server that manages each batch job. At the time the
.IR qalter
utility exits, it shall have modified the batch job corresponding to
each successfully processed batch
.IR job_identifier .
An attempt to alter the attributes of a batch job in the RUNNING state
is implementation-defined.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.IR qalter
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 12.2" ", " "Utility Syntax Guidelines".
.P
The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
.IP "\fB\(mia\ \fIdate_time\fR" 10
Redefine the time at which the batch job becomes eligible for
execution.
.RS 10 
.P
The
.IR date_time
argument shall be in the same form and represent the same time as for
the
.IR touch
utility. The time so represented shall be set into the
.IR Execution_Time
attribute of the batch job. If the time specified is earlier than the
current time, the
.BR \(mia
option shall have no effect.
.RE
.IP "\fB\(miA\ \fIaccount_string\fR" 10
.br
Redefine the account to which the resource consumption of the batch job
should be charged.
.RS 10 
.P
The syntax of the
.IR account_string
option-argument is unspecified.
.P
The
.IR qalter
utility shall set the
.IR Account_Name
attribute of the batch job to the value of the
.IR account_string
option-argument.
.RE
.IP "\fB\(mic\ \fIinterval\fR" 10
Redefine whether the batch job should be checkpointed, and if so, how
often.
.RS 10 
.P
The
.IR qalter
utility shall accept a value for the interval option-argument that is
one of the following:
.IP "\fRn\fP" 10
No checkpointing is to be performed on the batch job
(NO_CHECKPOINT).
.IP "\fRs\fP" 10
Checkpointing is to be performed only when the batch server is shut
down (CHECKPOINT_AT_SHUTDOWN).
.IP "\fRc\fP" 10
Automatic periodic checkpointing is to be performed at the
.IR Minimum_Cpu_Interval
attribute of the batch queue, in units of CPU minutes
(CHECKPOINT_AT_MIN_CPU_INTERVAL).
.IP "\fRc\fR=\fIminutes\fR" 10
Automatic periodic checkpointing is to be performed every
.IR minutes
of CPU time, or every
.IR Minimum_Cpu_Interval
minutes, whichever is greater. The
.IR minutes
argument shall conform to the syntax for unsigned integers and shall be
greater than zero.
.P
An implementation may define other checkpoint intervals. The
conformance document for an implementation shall describe any
alternative checkpoint intervals, how they are specified, their
internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the utility.
.P
The
.IR qalter
utility shall set the
.IR Checkpoint
attribute of the batch job to the value of the
.IR interval
option-argument.
.RE
.IP "\fB\(mie\ \fIpath_name\fR" 10
.br
Redefine the path to be used for the standard error stream of the batch
job.
.RS 10 
.P
The
.IR qalter
utility shall accept a
.IR path_name
option-argument that conforms to the syntax of the
.IR path_name
element defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008, which can be preceded by a host name
element of the form
.IR hostname :.
.P
If the
.IR path_name
option-argument constitutes an absolute pathname, the
.IR qalter
utility shall set the
.IR Error_Path
attribute of the batch job to the value of the
.IR path_name
option-argument, including the host name element, if present.
.P
If the
.IR path_name
option-argument constitutes a relative pathname and no host name
element is specified, the
.IR qalter
utility shall set the
.IR Error_Path
attribute of the batch job to the value of the absolute pathname
derived by expanding the
.IR path_name
option-argument relative to the current directory of the process that
executes the
.IR qalter
utility.
.P
If the
.IR path_name
option-argument constitutes a relative pathname and a host name
element is specified, the
.IR qalter
utility shall set the
.IR Error_Path
attribute of the batch job to the value of the option-argument without
expansion.
.P
If the
.IR path_name
option-argument does not include a host name element, the
.IR qalter
utility shall prefix the pathname in the
.IR Error_Path
attribute with
.IR hostname :,
where
.IR hostname
is the name of the host upon which the
.IR qalter
utility is being executed.
.RE
.IP "\fB\(mih\ \fIhold_list\fR" 10
Redefine the types of holds, if any, on the batch job. The
.IR qalter

USER
.IP "\fRs\fP" 6
SYSTEM
.IP "\fRo\fP" 6
OPERATOR
.P
If any of these characters are duplicated in the

All of the other batch job output streams specified shall be merged
into the output stream represented by the character listed first in the
.IR join_list
option-argument.
.P
For each unique character in the
.IR join_list
option-argument, the
.IR qalter
utility shall add a value to the
.IR Join_Path
attribute of the batch job as follows, each representing a different
batch job stream to join:
.IP "\fRe\fP" 6
The standard error of the batch job (JOIN_STD_ERROR).
.IP "\fRo\fP" 6
The standard output of the batch job (JOIN_STD_OUTPUT).

An existing
.IR Join_Path
attribute can be cleared by the join type:
.IP "\fRn\fP" 6
NO_JOIN
.P
If
.BR 'n' 
is specified, then no files are joined. The

utility shall consider it an error if any join type other than
.BR 'n' 
is combined with join type
.BR 'n' .
.P
Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of the characters
.BR 'e' ,
.BR 'o' ,
or
.BR 'n' 
within the
.IR join_list
option-argument. The
.IR qalter
utility shall permit the repetition of characters, but shall not assign

.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH RATIONALE
The
.IR qalter
utility allows users to change the attributes of a batch job.
.P
As a means of altering a queued job, the
.IR qalter
utility is superior to deleting and requeuing the batch job insofar as
an altered job retains its place in the queue with some traditional
selection algorithms. In addition, the
.IR qalter
utility is both shorter and simpler than a sequence of
.IR qdel
and
.IR qsub
utilities.
.P
The result of an attempt on the part of a user to alter a batch job in
a RUNNING state is implementation-defined because a batch job in the
RUNNING state will already have opened its output files and otherwise
performed any actions indicated by the options in effect at the time
the batch job began execution.
.P
The options processed by the
.IR qalter
utility are identical to those of the
.IR qsub
utility, with a few exceptions:
.BR \(miV ,
.BR \(miv ,
and
.BR \(miq .
The
.BR \(miV
and
.BR \(miv
are inappropriate for the
.IR qalter
utility, since they capture potentially transient environment
information from the submitting process. The
.BR \(miq
option would specify a new queue, which would largely negate the
previously stated advantage of using
.IR qalter ;
furthermore, the
.IR qmove
utility provides a superior means of moving jobs.
.P
Each of the following paragraphs provides the rationale for a
.IR qalter
option.
.P
Additional rationale concerning these options can be found in the
rationale for the
.IR qsub
utility.
.P
The
.BR \(mia
option allows users to alter the date and time at which a batch job
becomes eligible to run.
.P
The
.BR \(miA
option allows users to change the account that will be charged for the
resources consumed by the batch job. Support for the
.BR \(miA
option is mandatory for conforming implementations of
.IR qalter ,
even though support of accounting is optional for servers. Whether or
not to support accounting is left to the implementor of the server, but
mandatory support of the
.BR \(miA
option assures users of a consistent interface and allows them to
control accounting on servers that support accounting.
.P
The
.BR \(mic
option allows users to alter the checkpointing interval of a batch
job. A checkpointing system, which is not defined by POSIX.1\(hy2008, allows
recovery of a batch job at the most recent checkpoint in the event of a
crash. Checkpointing is typically used for jobs that consume expensive
computing time or must meet a critical schedule. Users should be
allowed to make the tradeoff between the overhead of checkpointing and
the risk to the timely completion of the batch job; therefore, this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008
provides the checkpointing interval option. Support for checkpointing
is optional for servers.
.P
The
.BR \(mie
option allows users to alter the name and location of the standard
error stream written by a batch job. However, the path of the standard
error stream is meaningless if the value of the
.IR Join_Path
attribute of the batch job is TRUE.
.P
The
.BR \(mih
option allows users to set the hold type in the
.IR Hold_Types
attribute of a batch job. The
.IR qhold
and
.IR qrls
utilities add or remove hold types to the
.IR Hold_Types
attribute, respectively. The
.BR \(mih
option has been modified to allow for implementation-defined hold
types.
.P
The
.BR \(mij
option allows users to alter the decision to join (merge) the standard
error stream of the batch job with the standard output stream of the
batch job.
.P
The
.BR \(mil
option allows users to change the resource limits imposed on a batch
job.
.P
The
.BR \(mim
option allows users to modify the list of points in the life of a batch
job at which the designated users will receive mail notification.
.P
The
.BR \(miM
option allows users to alter the list of users who will receive
notification about events in the life of a batch job.
.P
The
.BR \(miN
option allows users to change the name of a batch job.
.P
The
.BR \(mio
option allows users to alter the name and path to which the standard
output stream of the batch job will be written.
.P
The
.BR \(miP
option allows users to modify the priority of a batch job. Support for
priority is optional for batch servers.
.P
The
.BR \(mir
option allows users to alter the rerunability status of a batch job.
.P
The
.BR \(miS
option allows users to change the name and location of the shell image
that will be invoked to interpret the script of the batch job. This
option has been modified to allow a list of shell name and locations
associated with different hosts.
.P
The
.BR \(miu
option allows users to change the user identifier under which the batch
job will execute.
.P
The
.IR job_identifier
operand syntax is provided so that the user can differentiate between
the originating and destination (or executing) batch server. These may
or may not be the same. The .\c
.IR server_name
portion identifies the originating batch server, while the @\c
.IR server
portion identifies the destination batch server.
.P
Historically, the
.IR qalter
utility has been a component of the Network Queuing System (NQS), the
existing practice from which this utility has been derived.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
The
.IR qalter
utility may be removed in a future version.
