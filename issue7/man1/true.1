.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
This utility is typically used in shell scripts, as shown in the
EXAMPLES section. The special built-in utility
.BR :
is sometimes more efficient than
.IR true .
.SH EXAMPLES
This command is executed forever:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
while true
do
    command
done
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.SH RATIONALE
The
.IR true
utility has been retained in this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008, even though the shell special
built-in
.BR :
provides similar functionality, because
.IR true
is widely used in historical scripts and is less cryptic to novice
script readers.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
