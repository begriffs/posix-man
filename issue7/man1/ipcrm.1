.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR ipcrm
utility shall remove zero or more message queues, semaphore sets, or
shared memory segments. The interprocess communication facilities to be
removed are specified by the options.
.P
Only a user with appropriate privileges shall be allowed to remove an
interprocess communication facility that was not created by or owned by
the user invoking
.IR ipcrm .
.SH OPTIONS
The
.IR ipcrm
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 12.2" ", " "Utility Syntax Guidelines".
.P
The following options shall be supported:
.IP "\fB\(miq\ \fImsgid\fR" 10
Remove the message queue identifier
.IR msgid
from the system and destroy the message queue and data structure
associated with it.
.IP "\fB\(mim\ \fIshmid\fR" 10
Remove the shared memory identifier
.IR shmid
from the system. The shared memory segment and data structure
associated with it shall be destroyed after the last detach.
.IP "\fB\(mis\ \fIsemid\fR" 10
Remove the semaphore identifier
.IR semid
from the system and destroy the set of semaphores and data structure
associated with it.
.IP "\fB\(miQ\ \fImsgkey\fR" 10
Remove the message queue identifier, created with key
.IR msgkey ,
from the system and destroy the message queue and data structure
associated with it.
.IP "\fB\(miM\ \fIshmkey\fR" 10
Remove the shared memory identifier, created with key
.IR shmkey ,
from the system. The shared memory segment and data structure
associated with it shall be destroyed after the last detach.
.IP "\fB\(miS\ \fIsemkey\fR" 10
Remove the semaphore identifier, created with key
.IR semkey ,
from the system and destroy the set of semaphores and data structure
associated with it.
.SH OPERANDS
None.
.SH STDIN
Not used.
.SH "INPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
.IR ipcrm :
.IP "\fILANG\fP" 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 8.2" ", " "Internationalization Variables"
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.IP "\fILC_ALL\fP" 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.IP "\fILC_CTYPE\fP" 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
.IP "\fILC_MESSAGES\fP" 10
.br
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
.IP "\fINLSPATH\fP" 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
.IR LC_MESSAGES .
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
Default.
.SH STDOUT
Not used.
.SH STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
None.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values shall be returned:
.IP "\00" 6
Successful completion.
.IP >0 6
An error occurred.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
Default.
.LP
