.SH NAME
qrls
\(em release batch jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
qrls \fB[\fR\(mih \fIhold_list\fB] \fIjob_identifier\fR...
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A batch job might have one or more holds, which prevent the batch job
from executing. A batch job from which all the holds have been removed
becomes eligible for execution and is said to have been released. A
batch job hold is removed by sending a request to the batch server that
manages the batch job. The
.IR qrls
utility is a user-accessible client of batch services that requests
holds be removed from one or more batch jobs.
.P
The
.IR qrls
utility shall remove one or more holds from those batch jobs for which
a batch
.IR job_identifier
is presented to the utility.
.P
The
.IR qrls
utility shall remove holds from batch jobs in the order in which their
batch
.IR job_identifier s
are presented to the utility.
.P
If the
.IR qrls
utility fails to process a batch
.IR job_identifier
successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining batch
.IR job_identifier s,
if any.
.P
The
.IR qrls
utility shall remove holds on each batch job by sending a
.IR "Release Job Request"
to the batch server that manages the batch job.
.P
The
.IR qrls
utility shall not exit until the holds have been removed from the batch
job corresponding to each successfully processed batch
.IR job_identifier .
.SH OPTIONS
The
.IR qrls
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 12.2" ", " "Utility Syntax Guidelines".
.P
The following option shall be supported by the implementation:
.IP "\fB\(mih\ \fIhold_list\fR" 10
Define the types of holds to be removed from the batch job.
.RS 10 
.P
The
.IR qrls
.BR \(mih
option shall accept a value for the
.IR hold_list
option-argument that is a string of alphanumeric characters in the
portable character set (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 6.1" ", " "Portable Character Set").
.P
The
.IR qrls
utility shall accept a value for the
.IR hold_list
option-argument that is a string of one or more of the characters
.BR 'u' ,
.BR 's' ,
or
.BR 'o' ,
or the single character
.BR 'n' .
.P
For each unique character in the
.IR hold_list
option-argument, the
.IR qrls
utility shall add a value to the
.IR Hold_Types
attribute of the batch job as follows, each representing a different
hold type:
.IP "\fRu\fP" 6
USER
.IP "\fRs\fP" 6
SYSTEM
.IP "\fRo\fP" 6
OPERATOR
.P
If any of these characters are duplicated in the
.IR hold_list
option-argument, the duplicates shall be ignored.
.P
An existing
.IR Hold_Types
attribute can be cleared by the following hold type:
.IP "\fRn\fP" 6
NO_HOLD
.P
The
.IR qrls
utility shall consider it an error if any hold type other than
.BR 'n' 
is combined with hold type
.BR 'n' .
.P
Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of the characters
.BR 'u' ,
.BR 's' ,
.BR 'o' ,
or
.BR 'n' 
within the
.IR hold_list
option-argument. The
.IR qrls
utility shall permit the repetition of characters, but shall not assign
additional meaning to the repeated characters.
.P
An implementation may define other hold types. The conformance document
for an implementation shall describe any additional hold types, how
they are specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect the
behavior of the utility.
.P
If the
.BR \(mih
option is not presented to the
.IR qrls
utility, the implementation shall remove the USER hold in the
.IR Hold_Types
attribute.
.RE
.SH OPERANDS
The
.IR qrls
utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to the syntax
for a batch
.IR job_identifier
(see
.IR "Section 3.3.1" ", " "Batch Job Identifier").
.SH STDIN
Not used.
.SH "INPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
.IR qrls :
.IP "\fILANG\fP" 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 8.2" ", " "Internationalization Variables"
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the
values of locale categories.)
.IP "\fILC_ALL\fP" 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.IP "\fILC_CTYPE\fP" 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
.IP "\fILC_MESSAGES\fP" 10
.br
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
.IP "\fILOGNAME\fP" 10
Determine the login name of the user.
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
Default.
.SH STDOUT
None.
.SH STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
None.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values shall be returned:
.IP "\00" 6
Successful completion.
.IP >0 6
An error occurred.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
In addition to the default behavior, the
.IR qrls
utility shall not be required to write a diagnostic message to standard
error when the error reply received from a batch server indicates that
the batch
.IR job_identifier
does not exist on the server. Whether or not the
.IR qrls
utility waits to output the diagnostic message while attempting to
locate the job on other servers is implementation-defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH RATIONALE
The
.IR qrls
utility allows users, operators, and administrators to remove holds
from jobs.
.P
The
.IR qrls
utility does not support any job selection options or wildcard
arguments. Users may acquire a list of jobs selected by attributes
using the
.IR qselect
utility. For example, a user could select all of their held jobs.
.P
The
.BR \(mih
option allows the user to specify the type of hold that is to be
removed. This option allows for USER, SYSTEM, OPERATOR, and
implementation-defined hold types. The batch server that manages the
batch job will verify whether the user is authorized to remove the
specified hold for the batch job. If more than one type of hold has
been placed on the batch job, a user may wish to remove only some of
them.
.P
Mail is not required on release because the administrator has the tools
and libraries to build this option if required.
.P
The
.IR qrls
utility is a new utility \fIvis-a-vis\fP existing practice; it has been
defined in this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 as the natural complement to the
.IR qhold
utility.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
The
.IR qrls
utility may be removed in a future version.
