.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
type \fIname\fR...
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR type
utility shall indicate how each argument would be interpreted if used
as a command name.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
.IP "\fIname\fR" 10
A name to be interpreted.
.SH STDIN
Not used.
.SH "INPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
.IR type :
.IP "\fILANG\fP" 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 8.2" ", " "Internationalization Variables"
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.IP "\fILC_ALL\fP" 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.IP "\fILC_CTYPE\fP" 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
.IP "\fILC_MESSAGES\fP" 10
.br
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
.IP "\fINLSPATH\fP" 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
.IR LC_MESSAGES .
.IP "\fIPATH\fP" 10
Determine the location of
.IR name ,
as described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Chapter 8" ", " "Environment Variables".
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
Default.
.SH STDOUT
The standard output of
.IR type
contains information about each operand in an unspecified format. The
information provided typically identifies the operand as a shell
built-in, function, alias, or keyword, and where applicable, may
display the operand's pathname.
.SH STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
None.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values shall be returned:
.IP "\00" 6
Successful completion.
.IP >0 6
An error occurred.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
Default.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Since
.IR type
must be aware of the contents of the current shell execution
environment (such as the lists of commands, functions, and built-ins
processed by
.IR hash ),
it is always provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in
a separate utility execution environment, such as one of the
following:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
nohup type writer
find . \(mitype f | xargs type
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
it might not produce accurate results.
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
