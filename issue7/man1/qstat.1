.SH DESCRIPTION
The status of a batch job, batch queue, or batch server is obtained by
a request to the server. The
.IR qstat
utility is a user-accessible batch client that requests the status of
one or more batch jobs, batch queues, or servers, and writes the status
information to standard output.
.P
For each successfully processed batch
.IR job_identifier ,
the
.IR qstat
utility shall display information about the corresponding batch job.
.P
For each successfully processed destination, the
.IR qstat
utility shall display information about the corresponding batch queue.
.P
For each successfully processed server name, the
.IR qstat
utility shall display information about the corresponding server.
.P
The
.IR qstat
utility shall acquire batch job status information by sending a
.IR "Job Status Request"
to a batch server. The
.IR qstat
utility shall acquire batch queue status information by sending a
.IR "Queue Status Request"
to a batch server. The
.IR qstat
utility shall acquire server status information by sending a
.IR "Server Status Request"
to a batch server.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.IR qstat
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 12.2" ", " "Utility Syntax Guidelines".
.P
The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
.IP "\fB\(mif\fR" 10
Specify that a full display is produced.
.RS 10 
.P
The minimum contents of a full display are specified in the STDOUT
section.
.P
Additional contents and format of a full display are
implementation-defined.
.RE
.IP "\fB\(miQ\fR" 10
Specify that the operand is a destination.
.RS 10 
.P
The
.IR qstat
utility shall display information about each batch queue at each
destination identified as an operand.
.RE
.IP "\fB\(miB\fR" 10
Specify that the operand is a server name.
.RS 10 
.P
The
.IR qstat
utility shall display information about each server identified as an
operand.
.RE
.SH OPERANDS
If the
.BR \(miQ
option is presented to the
.IR qstat
utility, the utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to
the syntax for a destination (see
.IR "Section 3.3.2" ", " "Destination").
.P
If the
.BR \(miB
option is presented to the
.IR qstat
utility, the utility shall accept one or more
.IR server_name
operands.
.P
If neither the
.BR \(miB
nor the
.BR \(miQ
option is presented to the
.IR qstat
utility, the utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to
the syntax for a batch
.IR job_identifier
(see
.IR "Section 3.3.1" ", " "Batch Job Identifier").
.SH STDIN
Not used.
.SH "INPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of

.IP "\fIHOME\fP" 10
Determine the pathname of the user's home directory.
.IP "\fILANG\fP" 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 8.2" ", " "Internationalization Variables"
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the
values of locale categories.)
.IP "\fILC_ALL\fP" 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.IP "\fILC_COLLATE\fP" 10
.br

and multi-character collating elements within regular expressions.
.IP "\fILC_CTYPE\fP" 10

text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).

.br
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
.IP "\fILC_NUMERIC\fP" 10
.br

.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH RATIONALE
The
.IR qstat
utility allows users to display the status of jobs and list the
batch jobs in queues.
.P
The operands of the
.IR qstat
utility may be either job identifiers, queues (specified as destination
identifiers), or batch server names. The
.BR \(miQ
and
.BR \(miB
options, or absence thereof, indicate the nature of the operands.
.P
The other options of the
.IR qstat
utility allow the user to control the amount of information displayed
and the format in which it is displayed. Should a user wish to display
the status of a set of jobs that match a selection criteria, the
.IR qselect
utility may be used to acquire such a list.
.P
The
.BR \(mif
option allows users to request a ``full'' display in an
implementation-defined format.
.P
Historically, the
.IR qstat
utility has been a part of the NQS and its derivatives, the existing
practice on which it is based.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
The
.IR qstat
utility may be removed in a future version.
