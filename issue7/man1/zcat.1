.SH NAME
zcat
\(em expand and concatenate data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
zcat \fB[\fIfile\fR...\fB]\fR
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR zcat
utility shall write to standard output the uncompressed form of files
that have been compressed using the
.IR compress
utility. It is the equivalent of
.IR uncompress
.BR \(mic .
Input files are not affected.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH OPERANDS
The following operand shall be supported:
.IP "\fIfile\fR" 10
The pathname of a file previously processed by the
.IR compress
utility. If
.IR file
already has the
.BR .Z
suffix specified, it is used as submitted. Otherwise, the
.BR .Z
suffix is appended to the filename prior to processing.
.SH STDIN
The standard input shall be used only if no
.IR file
operands are specified, or if a
.IR file
operand is
.BR '\(mi' .
.SH "INPUT FILES"
Input files shall be compressed files that are in the format produced by
the
.IR compress
utility.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
.IR zcat :
.IP "\fILANG\fP" 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 8.2" ", " "Internationalization Variables"
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.IP "\fILC_ALL\fP" 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.IP "\fILC_CTYPE\fP" 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
.IP "\fILC_MESSAGES\fP" 10
.br
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
.IP "\fINLSPATH\fP" 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
.IR LC_MESSAGES .
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
Default.
.SH STDOUT
The compressed files given as input shall be written on standard output
in their uncompressed form.
.SH STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
None.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values shall be returned:
.IP "\00" 6
Successful completion.
.IP >0 6
An error occurred.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"

.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
