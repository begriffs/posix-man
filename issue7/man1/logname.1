.SH NAME
logname
\(em return the user's login name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
logname
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR logname
utility shall write the user's login name to standard output. The
login name shall be the string that would be returned by the
\fIgetlogin\fR()
function defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008. Under the conditions where the
\fIgetlogin\fR()
function would fail, the
.IR logname
utility shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and exit
with a non-zero exit status.
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.SH OPERANDS
None.
.SH STDIN
Not used.
.SH "INPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
.IR logname :
.IP "\fILANG\fP" 10
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are
unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 8.2" ", " "Internationalization Variables"
for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.IP "\fILC_ALL\fP" 10
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.IP "\fILC_CTYPE\fP" 10
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of
text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
multi-byte characters in arguments).
.IP "\fILC_MESSAGES\fP" 10
.br
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
.IP "\fINLSPATH\fP" 10
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
.IR LC_MESSAGES .
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
Default.
.SH STDOUT
The
.IR logname
utility output shall be a single line consisting of the user's login
name:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
"%s\en", <\fIlogin name\fR>
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.SH STDERR
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
None.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
None.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values shall be returned:
.IP "\00" 6
Successful completion.
.IP >0 6
An error occurred.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
Default.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
.IR logname
utility explicitly ignores the
.IR LOGNAME
environment variable because environment changes could produce
erroneous results.
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH RATIONALE
The
.BR passwd
file is not listed as required because the implementation may have
other means of mapping login names.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
