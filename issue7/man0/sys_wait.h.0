\(em declarations for waiting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/wait.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <sys/wait.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants for use with
\fIwaitpid\fR():
.IP WCONTINUED 14
Report status of continued child process.
.IP WNOHANG 14
Do not hang if no status is available; return immediately.
.IP WUNTRACED 14
Report status of stopped child process.
.P
The
.IR <sys/wait.h> 
header shall define the following macros for analysis of process status
values:
.IP WEXITSTATUS 14
Return exit status.
.IP WIFCONTINUED 14
True if child has been continued.
.IP WIFEXITED 14
True if child exited normally.
.IP WIFSIGNALED 14
True if child exited due to uncaught signal.
.IP WIFSTOPPED 14
True if child is currently stopped.
.IP WSTOPSIG 14
Return signal number that caused process to stop.
.IP WTERMSIG 14
Return signal number that caused process to terminate.
.P
The
.IR <sys/wait.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants as possible values
for the
.IR options
argument to
\fIwaitid\fR():
.IP WEXITED 14
Wait for processes that have exited.
.IP WNOWAIT 14
Keep the process whose status is returned in
.IR infop
in a waitable state.
.IP WSTOPPED 14
Status is returned for any child that has stopped upon receipt of a
signal.
.P
The
WCONTINUED
and WNOHANG constants, described above for
\fIwaitpid\fR(),
can also be used with
\fIwaitid\fR().
.P
The type
.BR idtype_t
shall be defined as an enumeration type whose possible values shall
include at least the following:
P_ALL
P_PGID
P_PID
.P
The
.IR <sys/wait.h> 
header shall define the
.BR id_t
and
.BR pid_t
types as described in
.IR <sys/types.h> .
.P
The
.IR <sys/wait.h> 
header shall define the
.BR siginfo_t
type as described in
.IR <signal.h> .
.P
Inclusion of the
.IR <sys/wait.h> 
header may also make visible
all symbols from
.IR <signal.h> .
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
