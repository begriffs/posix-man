.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Although no existing implementation defines AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW and
AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW as the same numeric value, POSIX.1\(hy2008 does not prohibit
that as the two constants are not used with the same interfaces.
.SH RATIONALE
While many of the symbolic constants introduced in the
.IR <fcntl.h> 
header do not strictly need to be used in
.BR #if
preprocessor directives, widespread historic practice has defined
them as macros that are usable in such constructs, and examination
of existing applications has shown that they are occasionally used in
such a way. Therefore it was decided to retain this requirement on an
implementation in POSIX.1\(hy2008.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
