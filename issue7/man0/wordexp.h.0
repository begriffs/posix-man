wordexp.h
\(em word-expansion types
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wordexp.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <wordexp.h> 
header shall define the structures and symbolic constants used by the
\fIwordexp\fR()
and
\fIwordfree\fR()
functions.
.P
The
.IR <wordexp.h> 
header shall define the
.BR wordexp_t
structure type, which shall include at least the following members:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
size_t   we_wordc  \fRCount of words matched by \fIwords.\fR
char   **we_wordv  \fRPointer to list of expanded words.\fR
size_t   we_offs   \fRSlots to reserve at the beginning of \fIwe_wordv.\fR
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
The
.IR <wordexp.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants for use as flags
for the
\fIwordexp\fR()
function:
.IP WRDE_APPEND 14
Append words to those previously generated.
.IP WRDE_DOOFFS 14
Number of null pointers to prepend to
.IR we_wordv .
.IP WRDE_NOCMD 14
Fail if command substitution is requested.
.IP WRDE_REUSE 14
The
.IR pwordexp
argument was passed to a previous successful call to
\fIwordexp\fR(),
and has not been passed to
\fIwordfree\fR().
The result is the same as if the application had called
\fIwordfree\fR()
and then called
\fIwordexp\fR()
without WRDE_REUSE.
.IP WRDE_SHOWERR 14
Do not redirect
.IR stderr
to
.BR /dev/null .
.IP WRDE_UNDEF 14
Report error on an attempt to expand an undefined shell variable.
.P
The
.IR <wordexp.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants as error
return values:
.IP WRDE_BADCHAR 14
One of the unquoted characters\(em\c
<newline>,
.BR '|' ,
.BR '&' ,
.BR ';' ,
.BR '<' ,
.BR '>' ,
.BR '(' ,
.BR ')' ,
.BR '{' ,
.BR '}' \(em\c
appears in
.IR words
in an inappropriate context.
.IP WRDE_BADVAL 14
Reference to undefined shell variable when WRDE_UNDEF is set in
.IR flags .
.IP WRDE_CMDSUB 14
Command substitution requested when WRDE_NOCMD was set in
.IR flags .
.IP WRDE_NOSPACE 14
Attempt to allocate memory failed.
.IP WRDE_SYNTAX 14
Shell syntax error, such as unbalanced parentheses or unterminated string.
.P
The
.IR <wordexp.h> 
header shall define the
.BR size_t
type as described in
.IR <stddef.h> .
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as
macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
int  wordexp(const char *restrict, wordexp_t *restrict, int);
void wordfree(wordexp_t *);
