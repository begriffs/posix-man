The
.IR <utmpx.h> 
header shall define the
.BR pid_t
type through
.BR typedef ,
as described in
.IR <sys/types.h> .

.IR <utmpx.h> 
header shall define the
.BR timeval
structure as described in
.IR <sys/time.h> .

member of the
.BR utmpx
structure:
.IP EMPTY 14
No valid user accounting information.
.IP BOOT_TIME 14
Identifies time of system boot.
.IP OLD_TIME 14
Identifies time when system clock changed.
.IP NEW_TIME 14
Identifies time after system clock changed.
.IP USER_PROCESS 14
Identifies a process.
.IP INIT_PROCESS 14
Identifies a process spawned by the init process.
.IP LOGIN_PROCESS 14
Identifies the session leader of a logged-in user.
.IP DEAD_PROCESS 14
