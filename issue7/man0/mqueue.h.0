.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <mqueue.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <mqueue.h> 
header shall define the
.BR mqd_t
type, which is used for message queue descriptors. This is not an
array type.
.P
The
.IR <mqueue.h> 
header shall define the
.BR pthread_attr_t ,
.BR size_t ,
and
.BR ssize_t
types as described in
.IR <sys/types.h> .
.P
The
.IR <mqueue.h> 
header shall define the
.BR "struct timespec"
structure as described in
.IR <time.h> .
.P
The tag
.BR sigevent
shall be declared as naming an incomplete structure type, the contents
of which are described in the
.IR <signal.h> 
header.
.P
The
.IR <mqueue.h> 
header shall define the
.BR mq_attr
structure, which is used in getting and setting the attributes of a
message queue. Attributes are initially set when the message queue is
created. An
.BR mq_attr
structure shall have at least the following fields:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
long    mq_flags    \fRMessage queue flags.\fP
long    mq_maxmsg   \fRMaximum number of messages.\fP
long    mq_msgsize  \fRMaximum message size.\fP
long    mq_curmsgs  \fRNumber of messages currently queued.\fP
.fi \fR

The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.

int      mq_close(mqd_t);
int      mq_getattr(mqd_t, struct mq_attr *);
int      mq_notify(mqd_t, const struct sigevent *);
mqd_t    mq_open(const char *, int, ...);
ssize_t  mq_receive(mqd_t, char *, size_t, unsigned *);
int      mq_send(mqd_t, const char *, size_t, unsigned);
int      mq_setattr(mqd_t, const struct mq_attr *restrict,
             struct mq_attr *restrict);
ssize_t  mq_timedreceive(mqd_t, char *restrict, size_t,
             unsigned *restrict, const struct timespec *restrict);
int      mq_timedsend(mqd_t, const char *, size_t, unsigned,
             const struct timespec *);
int      mq_unlink(const char *);
