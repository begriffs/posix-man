.SH NAME
sys/un.h
\(em definitions for UNIX domain sockets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/un.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <sys/un.h> 
header shall define the
.BR sockaddr_un
structure, which shall include at least the following members:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
sa_family_t  sun_family  \fRAddress family.\fR
char         sun_path[]  \fRSocket pathname.\fR
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
The
.BR sockaddr_un
structure is used to store addresses for UNIX domain sockets.
Pointers to this type shall be cast by applications to
.BR "struct sockaddr *"
for use with socket functions.
.P
The
.IR <sys/un.h> 
header shall define the
.BR sa_family_t
type as described in
.IR <sys/socket.h> .
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The size of
.IR sun_path
has intentionally been left undefined. This is because different
implementations use different sizes. For example, 4.3 BSD uses a size of
108, and 4.4 BSD uses a size of 104. Since most implementations
originate from BSD versions, the size is typically in the range 92 to
108.
.P
Applications should not assume a particular length for
.IR sun_path
or assume that it can hold
{_POSIX_PATH_MAX}
bytes (256).
.SH "RATIONALE"
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
