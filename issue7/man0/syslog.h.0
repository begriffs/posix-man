.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
#include <syslog.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <syslog.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants, zero or more
of which may be OR'ed together to form the
.IR logopt
option of
\fIopenlog\fR():
.IP LOG_PID 14
Log the process ID with each message.
.IP LOG_CONS 14
Log to the system console on error.
.IP LOG_NDELAY 14
Connect to syslog daemon immediately.
.IP LOG_ODELAY 14
Delay open until
\fIsyslog\fR()
is called.
.IP LOG_NOWAIT 14
Do not wait for child processes.
.P
The
.IR <syslog.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants for use as the
.IR facility
argument to
\fIopenlog\fR():
.IP LOG_KERN 14
Reserved for message generated by the system.
.IP LOG_USER 14
Message generated by a process.
.IP LOG_MAIL 14
Reserved for message generated by mail system.
.IP LOG_NEWS 14
Reserved for message generated by news system.
.IP LOG_UUCP 14
Reserved for message generated by UUCP system.
.IP LOG_DAEMON 14
Reserved for message generated by system daemon.
.IP LOG_AUTH 14
Reserved for message generated by authorization daemon.
.IP LOG_CRON 14
Reserved for message generated by clock daemon.
.IP LOG_LPR 14
Reserved for message generated by printer system.
.IP LOG_LOCAL0 14
Reserved for local use.
.IP LOG_LOCAL1 14
Reserved for local use.
.IP LOG_LOCAL2 14
Reserved for local use.
.IP LOG_LOCAL3 14
Reserved for local use.
.IP LOG_LOCAL4 14
Reserved for local use.
.IP LOG_LOCAL5 14
Reserved for local use.
.IP LOG_LOCAL6 14
Reserved for local use.
.IP LOG_LOCAL7 14

.P
The
.IR <syslog.h> 
header shall define the following macros for constructing the
.IR maskpri
argument to
\fIsetlogmask\fR().
The following macros expand to an expression of type
.BR int
when the argument
.IR pri
is an expression of type
.BR int :
.IP "LOG_MASK(\fIpri\fR)" 14
A mask for priority
.IR pri .
.P
The
.IR <syslog.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants for use as the
.IR priority
argument of
\fIsyslog\fR():
.IP LOG_EMERG 14
A panic condition was reported to all processes.
.IP LOG_ALERT 14
A condition that should be corrected immediately.
.IP LOG_CRIT 14
A critical condition.
.IP LOG_ERR 14
