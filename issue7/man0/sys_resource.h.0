.SH NAME
sys/resource.h
\(em definitions for XSI resource operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/resource.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <sys/resource.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants as possible values
of the
.IR which
argument of
\fIgetpriority\fR()
and
\fIsetpriority\fR():
.IP PRIO_PROCESS 16
Identifies the
.IR who
argument as a process ID.
.IP PRIO_PGRP 16
Identifies the
.IR who
argument as a process group ID.
.IP PRIO_USER 16
Identifies the
.IR who
argument as a user ID.
.P
The
.IR <sys/resource.h> 
header shall define the following type through
.BR typedef :
.IP "\fBrlim_t\fR" 16
Unsigned integer type used for limit values.
.P
The
.IR <sys/resource.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants, which shall have
values suitable for use in
.BR #if
preprocessing directives:
.IP RLIM_INFINITY 16
A value of
.BR rlim_t
indicating no limit.
.IP RLIM_SAVED_MAX 16
A value of type
.BR rlim_t
indicating an unrepresentable saved hard limit.
.IP RLIM_SAVED_CUR 16
A value of type
.BR rlim_t
indicating an unrepresentable saved soft limit.
.P
On implementations where all resource limits are representable in an
object of type
.BR rlim_t ,
RLIM_SAVED_MAX and RLIM_SAVED_CUR need not be distinct from
RLIM_INFINITY.
.P
The
.IR <sys/resource.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants as possible values
of the
.IR who
parameter of
\fIgetrusage\fR():
.IP RUSAGE_SELF 16
Returns information about the current process.
.IP RUSAGE_CHILDREN 16
Returns information about children of the current process.
.P
The
.IR <sys/resource.h> 
header shall define the
.BR rlimit
structure, which shall include at least the following members:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
rlim_t rlim_cur  \fRThe current (soft) limit.\fR
rlim_t rlim_max  \fRThe hard limit.\fR
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
The
.IR <sys/resource.h> 
header shall define the
.BR rusage
structure, which shall include at least the following members:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
struct timeval ru_utime  \fRUser time used.\fR
struct timeval ru_stime  \fRSystem time used.\fR
.fi \fR
.P

.P
The
.IR <sys/resource.h> 
header shall define the
.BR timeval
structure as described in
.IR <sys/time.h> .
.P
The
.IR <sys/resource.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants as possible values
for the
.IR resource
argument of
\fIgetrlimit\fR()
and
\fIsetrlimit\fR():
.IP RLIMIT_CORE 16
Limit on size of
.BR core
file.
.IP RLIMIT_CPU 16
Limit on CPU time per process.
.IP RLIMIT_DATA 16
Limit on data segment size.
.IP RLIMIT_FSIZE 16
Limit on file size.
.IP RLIMIT_NOFILE 16
Limit on number of open files.
.IP RLIMIT_STACK 16
Limit on stack size.
.IP RLIMIT_AS 16
Limit on address space size.
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as
macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
int  getpriority(int, id_t);
int  getrlimit(int, struct rlimit *);
int  getrusage(int, struct rusage *);
int  setpriority(int, id_t, int);
int  setrlimit(int, const struct rlimit *);
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
The
.IR <sys/resource.h> 
header shall define the
.BR id_t
type through
.BR typedef ,
as described in
.IR <sys/types.h> .
.P
Inclusion of the
.IR <sys/resource.h> 
header may also make visible all symbols from
.IR <sys/time.h> .
