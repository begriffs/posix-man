.SH NAME
sys/uio.h
\(em definitions for vector I/O operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/uio.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <sys/uio.h> 
header shall define the
.BR iovec
structure, which shall include at least the following members:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
void   *iov_base  \fRBase address of a memory region for input or output.\fR
size_t  iov_len   \fRThe size of the memory pointed to by \fIiov_base.\fR
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
The
.IR <sys/uio.h> 
header uses the
.BR iovec
structure for scatter/gather I/O.
.P
The
.IR <sys/uio.h> 
header shall define the
.BR ssize_t
and
.BR size_t
types as described in
.IR <sys/types.h> .
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
ssize_t readv(int, const struct iovec *, int);
ssize_t writev(int, const struct iovec *, int);
.fi \fR
.P

.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The implementation can put a limit on the number of scatter/gather
elements which can be processed in one call. The symbol
{IOV_MAX}
defined in
.IR <limits.h> 
should always be used to learn about the limits instead of assuming a
fixed value.
.SH RATIONALE
Traditionally, the maximum number of scatter/gather elements the system
can process in one call were described by the symbolic value
{UIO_MAXIOV}.
In IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1\(hy2001 this value is replaced by the constant
{IOV_MAX}
which can be found in
.IR <limits.h> .
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
