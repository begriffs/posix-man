#include <setjmp.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
Some of the functionality described on this reference page extends the
ISO\ C standard. Applications shall define the appropriate feature test macro
(see the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 2.2" ", " "The Compilation Environment")
to enable the visibility of these symbols in this header.
.P
The
.IR <setjmp.h> 
header shall define the array types
.BR jmp_buf
and
.BR sigjmp_buf .
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as
macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
