sys/msg.h
\(em XSI message queue structures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/msg.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <sys/msg.h> 
header shall define the following data types through
.BR typedef :
.IP "\fBmsgqnum_t\fP" 14
Used for the number of messages in the message queue.
.IP "\fBmsglen_t\fP" 14
Used for the number of bytes allowed in a message queue.
.P
These types shall be unsigned integer types that are able to store
values at least as large as a type
.BR "unsigned short" .
.P
The
.IR <sys/msg.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constant as a message
operation flag:
.IP MSG_NOERROR 14
No error if big message.
.P
The
.IR <sys/msg.h> 
header shall define the
.BR msqid_ds
structure, which shall include the following members:

msgqnum_t       msg_qnum   \fRNumber of messages currently on queue.\fR
msglen_t        msg_qbytes \fRMaximum number of bytes allowed on queue.\fR

The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
