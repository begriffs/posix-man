.SH NAME
dirent.h
\(em format of directory entries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <dirent.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The internal format of directories is unspecified.
.P
The
.IR <dirent.h> 
header shall define the following type:
.IP "\fBDIR\fR" 8
A type representing a directory stream. The
.BR DIR
type may be an incomplete type.
.P
It shall also define the structure
.BR dirent
which shall include the following members:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
ino_t  d_ino       \fRFile serial number.\fR
char   d_name[]    \fRFilename string of entry.\fR
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
The
.IR <dirent.h> 
header shall define the
.BR ino_t
type as described in
.IR <sys/types.h> .
.P
The array
.IR d_name
is of unspecified size, but shall contain a filename of at most
{NAME_MAX}
bytes followed by a terminating null byte.
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as
macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
int            alphasort(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **);
int            closedir(DIR *);
int            dirfd(DIR *);
DIR           *fdopendir(int);
DIR           *opendir(const char *);
struct dirent *readdir(DIR *);
int            readdir_r(DIR *restrict, struct dirent *restrict,
                   struct dirent **restrict);
void           rewinddir(DIR *);
int            scandir(const char *, struct dirent ***,
                   int (*)(const struct dirent *),
                   int (*)(const struct dirent **,
                   const struct dirent **));
void           seekdir(DIR *, long);
long           telldir(DIR *);

.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
Information similar to that in the
.IR <dirent.h> 
header is contained in a file
.IR <sys/dir.h> 
in 4.2 BSD and 4.3 BSD. The equivalent in these implementations of
.BR "struct dirent"
from this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 is
.BR "struct direct" .
The filename was changed because the name
.IR <sys/dir.h> 
was also used in earlier implementations to refer to definitions
related to the older access method; this produced name conflicts. The
name of the structure was changed because this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 does not completely
define what is in the structure, so it could be different on some
implementations from
.BR "struct direct" .
.P
The name of an array of
.BR char
of an unspecified size should not be used as an lvalue. Use of:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
sizeof(d_name)
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
is incorrect; use:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
strlen(d_name)
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
instead.
.P
The array of
.BR char
.IR d_name
is not a fixed size. Implementations may need to declare
.BR "struct dirent"
with an array size for
.IR d_name
of 1, but the actual number of bytes provided matches (or only slightly
exceeds) the length of the filename string.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
