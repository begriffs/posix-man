.SH NAME
sys/ipc.h
\(em XSI interprocess communication access structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/ipc.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <sys/ipc.h> 
header is used by three mechanisms for XSI interprocess communication
(IPC):
messages, semaphores, and shared memory. All use a common structure
type,
.BR ipc_perm ,
to pass information used in determining permission to perform an IPC
operation.
.P
The
.IR <sys/ipc.h> 
header shall define the
.BR ipc_perm
structure, which shall include the following members:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
uid_t    uid    \fROwner's user ID.\fR
gid_t    gid    \fROwner's group ID.\fR
uid_t    cuid   \fRCreator's user ID.\fR
gid_t    cgid   \fRCreator's group ID.\fR
mode_t   mode   \fRRead/write permission.\fR
.fi \fR
.P

.P
The
.IR <sys/ipc.h> 
header shall define the
.BR uid_t ,
.BR gid_t ,
.BR mode_t ,
and
.BR key_t
types as described in
.IR <sys/types.h> .
.P
The
.IR <sys/ipc.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants.
.P
Mode bits:
.IP IPC_CREAT 12
Create entry if key does not exist.
.IP IPC_EXCL 12
Fail if key exists.
.IP IPC_NOWAIT 12
Error if request must wait.
.P
Keys:
.IP IPC_PRIVATE 12
Private key.
.P
Control commands:
.IP IPC_RMID 12
Remove identifier.
.IP IPC_SET 12
Set options.
.IP IPC_STAT 12
Get options.
.P
The following shall be declared as a function and may also be defined
as a macro. A function prototype shall be provided.
