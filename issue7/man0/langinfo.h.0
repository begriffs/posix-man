.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Wherever possible, users are advised to use functions compatible with
those in the ISO\ C standard to access items of
.IR langinfo
data. In particular, the
\fIstrftime\fR()
function should be used to access date and time information defined in
category
.IR LC_TIME .
The
\fIlocaleconv\fR()
function should be used to access information corresponding to
RADIXCHAR, THOUSEP, and CRNCYSTR.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
