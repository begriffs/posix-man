glob.h
\(em pathname pattern-matching types
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <glob.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <glob.h> 
header shall define the structures and symbolic constants used by the
\fIglob\fR()
function.
.P
The
.IR <glob.h> 
header shall define the
.BR glob_t
structure type, which shall include at least the following members:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
size_t   gl_pathc \fRCount of paths matched by \fIpattern.\fR
char   **gl_pathv \fRPointer to a list of matched pathnames.\fR
size_t   gl_offs  \fRSlots to reserve at the beginning of \fIgl_pathv.\fR
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
The
.IR <glob.h> 
header shall define the
.BR size_t
type as described in
.IR <sys/types.h> .
.P
The
.IR <glob.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants as values for the
.IR flags
argument:
.IP GLOB_APPEND 14
Append generated pathnames to those previously obtained.
.IP GLOB_DOOFFS 14
Specify how many null pointers to add to the beginning of
.IR gl_pathv .
.IP GLOB_ERR 14
Cause
\fIglob\fR()
to return on error.
.IP GLOB_MARK 14
Each pathname that is a directory that matches
.IR pattern
has a
<slash>
appended.
.IP GLOB_NOCHECK 14
If
.IR pattern
does not match any pathname, then return a list consisting of only
.IR pattern .
.IP GLOB_NOESCAPE 14
Disable backslash escaping.
.IP GLOB_NOSORT 14
Do not sort the pathnames returned.
.P
The
.IR <glob.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constants as error
return values:
.IP GLOB_ABORTED 14
The scan was stopped because GLOB_ERR was set or (*\fIerrfunc\fP)(\|)
returned non-zero.
.IP GLOB_NOMATCH 14
The pattern does not match any existing pathname, and GLOB_NOCHECK was
not set in
.IR flags .
.IP GLOB_NOSPACE 14
An attempt to allocate memory failed.
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
int  glob(const char *restrict, int, int(*)(const char *, int),
         glob_t *restrict);
void globfree(glob_t *);
