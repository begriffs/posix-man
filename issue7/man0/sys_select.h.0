The
.IR <sys/select.h> 
header shall define the
.BR time_t
and
.BR suseconds_t
types as described in
.IR <sys/types.h> .
.P
The
.IR <sys/select.h> 
header shall define the
.BR sigset_t
type as described in
.IR <signal.h> .
.P
The
.IR <sys/select.h> 
header shall define the
.BR timespec
structure as described in
.IR <time.h> .
.P
The
.IR <sys/select.h> 
header shall define the
.BR fd_set
type as a structure.
.P
The
.IR <sys/select.h> 
header shall define the following symbolic constant, which shall have
a value suitable for use in
.BR #if
preprocessing directives:
.IP FD_SETSIZE 12
Maximum number of file descriptors in an
.BR fd_set
structure.
.P
The following shall be declared as functions, defined as macros, or
both. If functions are declared, function prototypes shall be
provided.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
void FD_CLR(int, fd_set *);
int  FD_ISSET(int, fd_set *);
void FD_SET(int, fd_set *);
void FD_ZERO(fd_set *);
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
If implemented as macros, these may evaluate their arguments more than
once, so applications should ensure that the arguments they supply are
never expressions with side-effects.
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as
macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
int  pselect(int, fd_set *restrict, fd_set *restrict, fd_set *restrict,
         const struct timespec *restrict, const sigset_t *restrict);
int  select(int, fd_set *restrict, fd_set *restrict, fd_set *restrict,
         struct timeval *restrict);
