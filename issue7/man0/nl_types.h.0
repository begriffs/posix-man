nl_types.h
\(em data types
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <nl_types.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.IR <nl_types.h> 
header shall define at least the following types:
.IP "\fBnl_catd\fP" 14
Used by the message catalog functions
\fIcatopen\fR(),
\fIcatgets\fR(),
and
\fIcatclose\fR()
to identify a catalog descriptor.
.IP "\fBnl_item\fP" 14
Used by
\fInl_langinfo\fR()
to identify items of
.IR langinfo
data. Values of objects of type
.BR nl_item
are defined in
.IR <langinfo.h> .
.P
The
.IR <nl_types.h> 
header shall define at least the following symbolic constants:
.IP NL_SETD 14
Used by
.IR gencat
when no $\fIset\fP directive is specified in a message text source
file. This constant can be passed as the value of
.IR set_id
on subsequent calls to
\fIcatgets\fR()
(that is, to retrieve messages from the default message set). The
value of NL_SETD is implementation-defined.
.IP NL_CAT_LOCALE 14
Value that must be passed as the
.IR oflag
argument to
\fIcatopen\fR()
to ensure that message catalog selection depends on the
.IR LC_MESSAGES
locale category, rather than directly on the
.IR LANG
environment variable.
.P
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as
macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
