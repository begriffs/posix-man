.SH NAME
assert.h
\(em verify program assertion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <assert.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
.IR <assert.h> 
header shall define the
\fIassert\fR()
macro. It refers to the macro NDEBUG
which is not defined in the header. If NDEBUG is defined as a macro
name before the inclusion of this header, the
\fIassert\fR()
macro shall be defined simply as:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
#define assert(ignore)((void) 0)
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
Otherwise, the macro behaves as described in
\fIassert\fR().
.P
The
\fIassert\fR()
macro shall be redefined according to the current state of NDEBUG each
time
.IR <assert.h> 
is included.
.P
The
\fIassert\fR()
macro shall be implemented as a macro, not as a function. If the macro
definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function, the
behavior is undefined.
