.SH NAME
feholdexcept
\(em save current floating-point environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <fenv.h>
.P
int feholdexcept(fenv_t *\fIenvp\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIfeholdexcept\fR()
function shall save the current floating-point environment in the
object pointed to by
.IR envp ,
clear the floating-point status flags, and then install a non-stop
(continue on floating-point exceptions) mode, if available, for all
floating-point exceptions.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIfeholdexcept\fR()
function shall return zero if and only if non-stop floating-point
exception handling was successfully installed.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
The
\fIfeholdexcept\fR()
function should be effective on typical IEC\ 60559:\|1989 standard implementations which
have the default non-stop mode and at least one other mode for trap
handling or aborting. If the implementation provides only the non-stop
mode, then installing the non-stop mode is trivial.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
