.SH NAME
getc
\(em get a byte from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
.P
int getc(FILE *\fIstream\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIgetc\fR()
function shall be equivalent to
.IR "\fIfgetc\fR\^(\|)",
except that if it is implemented as a macro it may evaluate
.IR stream
more than once, so the argument should never be an expression with
side-effects.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Refer to
.IR "\fIfgetc\fR\^(\|)".
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIfgetc\fR\^(\|)".
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
If the integer value returned by
\fIgetc\fR()
is stored into a variable of type
.BR char
and then compared against the integer constant EOF, the comparison may
never succeed, because sign-extension of a variable of type
.BR char
on widening to integer is implementation-defined.
.P
Since it may be implemented as a macro,
\fIgetc\fR()
may treat incorrectly a
.IR stream
argument with side-effects. In particular,
.IR getc (* f \(pl\(pl)
does not necessarily work as expected. Therefore, use of this function
should be preceded by
.BR \(dq#undef getc\(dq 
in such situations;
\fIfgetc\fR()
could also be used.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
