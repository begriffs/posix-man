.SH NAME
j0,
j1,
jn
\(em Bessel functions of the first kind
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double j0(double \fIx\fP);
double j1(double \fIx\fP);
double jn(int \fIn\fP, double \fIx\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIj0\fR(),
\fIj1\fR(),
and
\fIjn\fR()
functions shall compute Bessel functions of
.IR x
of the first kind of orders 0, 1, and
.IR n ,
respectively.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the relevant
Bessel value of
.IR x
of the first kind.
.P
If the
.IR x
argument is too large in magnitude, or the correct result would cause
underflow, 0 shall be returned and a range error may occur.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
was too large in magnitude, or an underflow occurred.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.P
No other errors shall occur.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
