.SH NAME
uselocale
\(em use locale in current thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <locale.h>
.P
locale_t uselocale(locale_t \fInewloc\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIuselocale\fR()
function shall set the current locale for the current thread to the
locale represented by
.IR newloc .
.P
The value for the
.IR newloc
argument shall be one of the following:
.IP " 1." 4
A value returned by the
\fInewlocale\fR()
or
\fIduplocale\fR()
functions
.IP " 2." 4
The special locale object descriptor LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE
.IP " 3." 4
(\c
.BR locale_t )0
.P
Once the
\fIuselocale\fR()
function has been called to install a thread-local locale, the behavior
of every interface using data from the current locale shall be affected
for the calling thread. The current locale for other threads shall
remain unchanged.
.P
If the
.IR newloc
argument is (\c
.BR locale_t )0,
the object returned is the current locale or LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE if there
has been no previous call to
\fIuselocale\fR()
for the current thread.
.P
If the
.IR newloc
argument is LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE, the thread shall use the global locale
determined by the
\fIsetlocale\fR()
function.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIuselocale\fR()
function shall return the locale handle from the previous call for the
current thread, or LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE if there was no such previous call.
Otherwise,
\fIuselocale\fR()
shall return (\c
.BR locale_t )0
and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIuselocale\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
.IR locale
is not a valid locale object.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Unlike the
\fIsetlocale\fR()
function, the
\fIuselocale\fR()
function does not allow replacing some locale categories
only. Applications that need to install a locale which differs only in
a few categories must use
\fInewlocale\fR()
to change a locale object equivalent to the currently used locale and
install it.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
