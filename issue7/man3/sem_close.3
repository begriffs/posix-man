.SH NAME
sem_close
\(em close a named semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <semaphore.h>
.P
int sem_close(sem_t *\fIsem\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIsem_close\fR()
function shall indicate that the calling process is finished using
the named semaphore indicated by
.IR sem .
The effects of calling
\fIsem_close\fR()
for an unnamed semaphore (one created by
\fIsem_init\fR())
are undefined. The
\fIsem_close\fR()
function shall deallocate (that is, make available for reuse by a
subsequent
\fIsem_open\fR()
by this process) any system resources allocated by the system for use
by this process for this semaphore. The effect of subsequent use of the
semaphore indicated by
.IR sem
by this process is undefined. If the semaphore has not been removed
with a successful call to
\fIsem_unlink\fR(),
then
\fIsem_close\fR()
has no effect on the state of the semaphore. If the
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
function has been successfully invoked for
.IR name
after the most recent call to
\fIsem_open\fR()
with O_CREAT for this semaphore,
then when all processes that have opened the semaphore close it, the
semaphore is no longer accessible.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, a value of zero shall be returned.
Otherwise, a value of \(mi1 shall be returned and
.IR errno
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIsem_close\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR sem
argument is not a valid semaphore descriptor.
