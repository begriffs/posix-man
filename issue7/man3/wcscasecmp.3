.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIwcscasecmp\fR()
and
\fIwcsncasecmp\fR()
functions are the wide-character equivalent of the
\fIstrcasecmp\fR()
and
\fIstrncasecmp\fR()
functions, respectively.
.P
The
\fIwcscasecmp\fR()
and
\fIwcscasecmp_l\fR()
functions shall compare, while ignoring differences in case, the
wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws1
to the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws2 .
.P
The
\fIwcsncasecmp\fR()
and
\fIwcsncasecmp_l\fR()
functions shall compare, while ignoring differences in case, not more
than
.IR n
wide-characters from the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws1
to the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws2 .
.P
The
\fIwcscasecmp\fR()
and
\fIwcsncasecmp\fR()
functions use the current locale to determine the case of the wide
characters.
.P
The
\fIwcscasecmp_l\fR()
and
\fIwcsncasecmp_l\fR()
functions use the locale represented by
.IR locale
to determine the case of the wide characters.
.P
When the
.IR LC_CTIME
category of the locale being used is from the POSIX locale, these
functions shall behave as if the wide-character strings had been converted
to lowercase and then a comparison of wide-character codes performed.
Otherwise, the results are unspecified.
.P
The information for
\fIwcscasecmp_l\fR()
and
\fIwcsncasecmp_l\fR()
about the case of the characters comes from the locale represented by
.IR locale .
.P
The behavior is undefined if the
.IR locale
argument to
\fIwcscasecmp_l\fR()
or
\fIwcsncasecmp_l\fR()
is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
object handle.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon completion, the
\fIwcscasecmp\fR()
and
\fIwcscasecmp_l\fR()
functions shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0
if the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws1
is, ignoring case, greater than, equal to, or less than the
wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws2 ,
respectively.
.P
Upon completion, the
\fIwcsncasecmp\fR()
and
\fIwcsncasecmp_l\fR()
functions shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0
if the possibly null wide-character terminated string pointed to by
.IR ws1
is, ignoring case, greater than, equal to, or less than the possibly
null wide-character terminated string pointed to by
.IR ws2 ,
respectively.
.P
No return values are reserved to indicate an error.
