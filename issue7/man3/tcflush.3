.SH NAME
tcflush
\(em flush non-transmitted output data, non-read input data, or both
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>
.P
int tcflush(int \fIfildes\fP, int \fIqueue_selector\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Upon successful completion,
\fItcflush\fR()
shall discard data written to the object referred to by
.IR fildes
(an open file descriptor associated with a terminal) but not
transmitted, or data received but not read, depending on the value of
.IR queue_selector :
.IP " *" 4
If
.IR queue_selector
is TCIFLUSH, it shall flush data received but not read.
.IP " *" 4
If
.IR queue_selector
is TCOFLUSH, it shall flush data written but not transmitted.
.IP " *" 4
If
.IR queue_selector
is TCIOFLUSH, it shall flush both data received but not read and data
written but not transmitted.
.P
Attempts to use
\fItcflush\fR()
from a process which is a member of a background process group on a
.IR fildes
associated with its controlling terminal shall cause the process group
to be sent a SIGTTOU signal.
If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is
ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the
operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, \(mi1
shall be returned and
.IR errno
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fItcflush\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The
.IR fildes
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR queue_selector
argument is not a supported value.
.TP
.BR EIO
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the calling thread
is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is not ignoring SIGTTOU.
.TP
.BR ENOTTY
The file associated with
.IR fildes
is not a terminal.
