.SH NAME
feupdateenv
\(em update floating-point environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <fenv.h>
.P
int feupdateenv(const fenv_t *\fIenvp\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIfeupdateenv\fR()
function shall attempt to save the currently raised floating-point
exceptions in its automatic storage, attempt to install the
floating-point environment represented by the object pointed to by
.IR envp ,
and then attempt to raise the saved floating-point exceptions. The
argument
.IR envp
shall point to an object set by a call to
\fIfeholdexcept\fR()
or
\fIfegetenv\fR(),
or equal a floating-point environment macro.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIfeupdateenv\fR()
function shall return a zero value if and only if all the required
actions were successfully carried out.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example shows sample code to hide spurious underflow
floating-point exceptions:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
#include <fenv.h>
double f(double x)
{
    #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
    double result;
    fenv_t save_env;
    feholdexcept(&save_env);
    // compute result
    if (/* test spurious underflow */)
    feclearexcept(FE_UNDERFLOW);
    feupdateenv(&save_env);
    return result;
}
