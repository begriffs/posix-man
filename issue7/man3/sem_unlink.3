.SH NAME
sem_unlink
\(em remove a named semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <semaphore.h>
.P
int sem_unlink(const char *\fIname\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
function shall remove the semaphore named by the string
.IR name .
If the semaphore named by
.IR name
is currently referenced by other processes, then
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
shall have no effect on the state of the semaphore. If one or more
processes have the semaphore open when
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
is called, destruction of the semaphore is postponed until all
references to the semaphore have been destroyed by calls to
\fIsem_close\fR(),
\fI_exit\fR(),
or
.IR exec .
Calls to
\fIsem_open\fR()
to recreate or reconnect to the semaphore refer to a new semaphore
after
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
is called. The
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
call shall not block until all references have been destroyed; it
shall return immediately.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
function shall return a value of 0. Otherwise, the semaphore shall not
be changed and the function shall return a value of \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EACCES
Permission is denied to unlink the named semaphore.
.TP
.BR ENOENT
The named semaphore does not exist.
.P
The
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR ENAMETOOLONG
.br
The length of the
.IR name
argument exceeds
{_POSIX_PATH_MAX}
on systems that do not support the XSI option
or exceeds
{_XOPEN_PATH_MAX}
on XSI systems,
or has a pathname component that is longer than
{_POSIX_NAME_MAX}
on systems that do not support the XSI option
or longer than
{_XOPEN_NAME_MAX}
on XSI systems.
A call to
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
with a
.IR name
argument that contains the same semaphore name as was previously used
in a successful
\fIsem_open\fR()
call shall not give an
.BR [ENAMETOOLONG] 
error.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
A future version might require the
\fIsem_open\fR()
and
\fIsem_unlink\fR()
functions to have semantics similar to normal file system operations.
