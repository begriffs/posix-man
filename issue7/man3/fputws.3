.SH NAME
fputws
\(em put a wide-character string on a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
.P
int fputws(const wchar_t *restrict \fIws\fP, FILE *restrict \fIstream\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIfputws\fR()
function shall write a character string corresponding to the
(null-terminated) wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws
to the stream pointed to by
.IR stream .
No character corresponding to the terminating null wide-character code
shall be written.
.P
The last data modification and last file status change timestamps
of the file shall be marked for update between the successful
execution of
\fIfputws\fR()
and the next successful completion of a call to
\fIfflush\fR()
or
\fIfclose\fR()
on the same stream or a call to
\fIexit\fR()
or
\fIabort\fR().
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIfputws\fR()
shall return a non-negative number. Otherwise,
it shall return \(mi1, set an error indicator for the stream,
and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIfputwc\fR\^(\|)".
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIfputws\fR()
function does not append a
<newline>.
.P
This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 requires that successful completion simply return a non-negative
integer. There are at least three known different implementation
conventions for this requirement:
.IP " *" 4
Return a constant value.
.IP " *" 4
Return the last character written.
.IP " *" 4
Return the number of bytes written. Note that this implementation
convention cannot be adhered to for strings longer than
{INT_MAX}
bytes as the value would not be representable in the return type of the
function. For backwards-compatibility, implementations can return the
number of bytes for strings of up to
{INT_MAX}
bytes, and return
{INT_MAX}
for all longer strings.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
