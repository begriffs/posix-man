.SH NAME
tcflow
\(em suspend or restart the transmission or reception of data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>
.P
int tcflow(int \fIfildes\fP, int \fIaction\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fItcflow\fR()
function shall suspend or restart transmission or reception of data on
the object referred to by
.IR fildes ,
depending on the value of
.IR action .
The
.IR fildes
argument is an open file descriptor associated with a terminal.
.IP " *" 4
If
.IR action
is TCOOFF, output shall be suspended.
.IP " *" 4
If
.IR action
is TCOON, suspended output shall be restarted.
.IP " *" 4
If
.IR action
is TCIOFF and
.IR fildes
refers to a terminal device, the system shall transmit a STOP character,
which is intended to cause the terminal device to stop transmitting data
to the system. If
.IR fildes
is associated with a pseudo-terminal, the STOP character need not be
transmitted.
.IP " *" 4
If
.IR action
is TCION and
.IR fildes
refers to a terminal device, the system shall transmit a START character,
which is intended to cause the terminal device to start transmitting
data to the system. If
.IR fildes
is associated with a pseudo-terminal, the START character need not be
transmitted.
.P
The default on the opening of a terminal file is that neither its input
nor its output are suspended.
.P
Attempts to use
\fItcflow\fR()
from a process which is a member of a background process group on a
.IR fildes
associated with its controlling terminal, shall cause the process group
to be sent a SIGTTOU signal.
If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is
ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the
operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, \(mi1
shall be returned and
.IR errno
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fItcflow\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The
.IR fildes
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR action
argument is not a supported value.
.TP
.BR EIO
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the calling thread
is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is not ignoring SIGTTOU.
.TP
.BR ENOTTY
The file associated with
.IR fildes
is not a terminal.
