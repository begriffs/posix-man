.SH NAME
clock
\(em report CPU time used
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <time.h>
.P
clock_t clock(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIclock\fR()
function shall return the implementation's best approximation to the
processor time used by the process since the beginning of an
implementation-defined era related only to the process invocation.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
To determine the time in seconds, the value returned by
\fIclock\fR()
should be divided by the value of the macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC.
CLOCKS_PER_SEC is defined to be one million in
.IR <time.h> .
If the processor time used is not available or its value cannot be
represented, the function shall return the value (\c
.BR clock_t )\(mi1.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
In order to measure the time spent in a program,
\fIclock\fR()
should be called at the start of the program and its return value
subtracted from the value returned by subsequent calls. The value
returned by
\fIclock\fR()
is defined for compatibility across systems that have clocks with
different resolutions. The resolution on any particular system need
not be to microsecond accuracy.
.P
The value returned by
\fIclock\fR()
may wrap around on some implementations. For example, on a machine with
32-bit values for
.BR clock_t ,
it wraps after 2\|147 seconds or 36 minutes.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
