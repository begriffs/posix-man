.SH NAME
fgetpos
\(em get current file position information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
.P
int fgetpos(FILE *restrict \fIstream\fP, fpos_t *restrict \fIpos\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIfgetpos\fR()
function shall store the current values of the parse state (if any)
and file position indicator for the stream pointed to by
.IR stream
in the object pointed to by
.IR pos .
The value stored contains unspecified information usable by
\fIfsetpos\fR()
for repositioning the stream to its position at the time of the call to
\fIfgetpos\fR().
.P
The
\fIfgetpos\fR()
function shall not change the setting of
.IR errno
if successful.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIfgetpos\fR()
shall return 0; otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIfgetpos\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The file descriptor underlying
.IR stream
is not valid.
.TP
.BR EOVERFLOW
The current value of the file position cannot be represented correctly
in an object of type
.BR fpos_t .
.TP
.BR ESPIPE
The file descriptor underlying
.IR stream
is associated with a pipe, FIFO, or socket.
