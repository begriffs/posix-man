\(em get name of the slave pseudo-terminal device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
char *ptsname(int \fIfildes\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIptsname\fR()
function shall return the name of the slave pseudo-terminal device
associated with a master pseudo-terminal device. The
.IR fildes
argument is a file descriptor that refers to the master device. The
\fIptsname\fR()
function shall return a pointer to a string containing the pathname
of the corresponding slave device.
.P
The
\fIptsname\fR()
function need not be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIptsname\fR()
shall return a pointer to a string which is the name of the
pseudo-terminal slave device. Upon failure,
\fIptsname\fR()
shall return a null pointer. This could occur if
.IR fildes
is an invalid file descriptor or if the slave device name does not
exist in the file system.
.P
The application shall not modify the string returned. The returned
pointer might be invalidated or the string content might be overwritten
by a subsequent call to
\fIptsname\fR().
