.SH NAME
fdim,
fdimf,
fdiml
\(em compute positive difference between two floating-point numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double fdim(double \fIx\fP, double \fIy\fP);
float fdimf(float \fIx\fP, float \fIy\fP);
long double fdiml(long double \fIx\fP, long double \fIy\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall determine the positive difference between their
arguments. If
.IR x
is greater than
.IR y ,
.IR x \(mi\c
.IR y
is returned. If
.IR x
is less than or equal to
.IR y ,
+0 is returned.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the positive
difference value.
.P
If
.IR x \(mi\c
.IR y
is positive and overflows, a range error shall occur and
\fIfdim\fR(),
\fIfdimf\fR(),
and
\fIfdiml\fR()
shall return the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, and HUGE_VALL,
respectively.
.P
If the correct value would cause underflow, a range error may occur, and
\fIfdim\fR(),
\fIfdimf\fR(),
and
\fIfdiml\fR()
shall return
the correct value, or
(if the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option is not supported) an
implementation-defined value no greater in magnitude than DBL_MIN,
FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
or
.IR y
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIfdim\fR()
function shall fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result overflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.P
The
\fIfdim\fR()
function may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result underflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
