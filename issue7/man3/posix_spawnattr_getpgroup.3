.SH NAME
posix_spawnattr_getpgroup,
posix_spawnattr_setpgroup
\(em get and set the spawn-pgroup attribute of a spawn attributes object
(\fBADVANCED REALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>
.P
int posix_spawnattr_getpgroup(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict \fIattr\fP,
    pid_t *restrict \fIpgroup\fP);
int posix_spawnattr_setpgroup(posix_spawnattr_t *\fIattr\fP, pid_t \fIpgroup\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIposix_spawnattr_getpgroup\fR()
function shall obtain the value of the
.IR spawn-pgroup
attribute from the attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
.P
The
\fIposix_spawnattr_setpgroup\fR()
function shall set the
.IR spawn-pgroup
attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
.P
The
.IR spawn-pgroup
attribute represents the process group to be joined by the new process
image in a spawn operation (if POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP is set in the
.IR spawn-flags
attribute). The default value of this attribute shall be zero.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIposix_spawnattr_getpgroup\fR()
shall return zero and store the value of the
.IR spawn-pgroup
attribute of
.IR attr
into the object referenced by the
.IR pgroup
parameter; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.
.P
Upon successful completion,
\fIposix_spawnattr_setpgroup\fR()
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value specified by
.IR attr
is invalid.
.P
