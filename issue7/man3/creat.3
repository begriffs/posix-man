.SH NAME
creat
\(em create a new file or rewrite an existing one
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
.P
int creat(const char *\fIpath\fP, mode_t \fImode\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIcreat\fR()
function shall behave as if it is implemented as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
int creat(const char *path, mode_t mode)
{
    return open(path, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, mode);
}
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Refer to
.IR "\fIopen\fR\^(\|)".
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIopen\fR\^(\|)".
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Creating a File"
.P
The following example creates the file
.BR /tmp/file
with read and write permissions for the file owner and read permission
for group and others. The resulting file descriptor is assigned to the
.IR fd
variable.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
#include <fcntl.h>
\&...
int fd;
mode_t mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH;
char *pathname = "/tmp/file";
\&...
fd = creat(pathname, mode);
\&...
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
The
\fIcreat\fR()
function is redundant. Its services are also provided by the
\fIopen\fR()
function. It has been included primarily for historical purposes since
many existing applications depend on it. It is best considered a part
of the C binding rather than a function that should be provided in
other languages.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
