void endnetent(void);
struct netent *getnetbyaddr(uint32_t \fInet\fP, int \fItype\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions shall retrieve information about networks. This
information is considered to be stored in a database that can be
accessed sequentially or randomly. The implementation of this database
is unspecified.
.P
The
\fIsetnetent\fR()
function shall open and rewind the database. If the
.IR stayopen
argument is non-zero, the connection to the
.IR net
database shall not be closed after each call to
\fIgetnetent\fR()
(either directly, or indirectly through one of the other
.IR getnet* (\|)
functions), and the implementation may maintain an open file descriptor
to the database.
.P
The
\fIgetnetent\fR()
function shall read the next entry of the database, opening and
closing a connection to the database as necessary.
.P
The
\fIgetnetbyaddr\fR()
function shall search the database from the beginning, and find the
first entry for which the address family specified by
.IR type
matches the
.IR n_addrtype
member and the network number
.IR net
matches the
.IR n_net
member, opening and closing a connection to the database as necessary.
The
.IR net
argument shall be the network number in host byte order.
.P
The
\fIgetnetbyname\fR()
function shall search the database from the beginning and find the
first entry for which the network name specified by
.IR name
matches the
.IR n_name
member, opening and closing a connection to the database as necessary.
.P
The
\fIgetnetbyaddr\fR(),
\fIgetnetbyname\fR(),
and
\fIgetnetent\fR()
functions shall each return a pointer to a
.BR netent
structure, the members of which shall contain the fields of an entry in
the network database.
.P
The
\fIendnetent\fR()
function shall close the database, releasing any open file descriptor.
.P
These functions need not be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIgetnetbyaddr\fR(),
\fIgetnetbyname\fR(),
and
\fIgetnetent\fR()
shall return a pointer to a
.BR netent
structure if the requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the
end of the database was reached or the requested entry was not found.
Otherwise, a null pointer shall be returned.
.P
The application shall not modify the structure to which the return
value points, nor any storage areas pointed to by pointers within the
structure. The returned pointer, and pointers within the structure,
might be invalidated or the structure or the storage areas might be
overwritten by a subsequent call to
\fIgetnetbyaddr\fR(),
\fIgetnetbyname\fR(),
or
\fIgetnetent\fR().
