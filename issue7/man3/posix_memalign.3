.SH NAME
posix_memalign
\(em aligned memory allocation
(\fBADVANCED REALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
int posix_memalign(void **\fImemptr\fP, size_t \fIalignment\fP, size_t \fIsize\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIposix_memalign\fR()
function shall allocate
.IR size
bytes aligned on a boundary specified by
.IR alignment ,
and shall return a pointer to the allocated memory in
.IR memptr .
The value of
.IR alignment
shall be a power of two multiple of
.IR sizeof (\c
.BR "void *" ).
.P
Upon successful completion, the value pointed to by
.IR memptr
shall be a multiple of
.IR alignment .
.P
If the size of the space requested is 0, the behavior is
implementation-defined; the value returned in
.IR memptr
shall be either a null pointer or a unique pointer.
.P
The
\fIfree\fR()
function shall deallocate memory that has previously been allocated by
\fIposix_memalign\fR().
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIposix_memalign\fR()
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIposix_memalign\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of the alignment parameter is not a power of two multiple of
.IR sizeof (\c
.BR "void *" ).
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory available with the requested alignment.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIposix_memalign\fR()
function is part of the Advisory Information option and need not be
provided on all implementations.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
