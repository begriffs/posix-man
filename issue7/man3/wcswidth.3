The
\fIwcswidth\fR()
function either shall return 0 (if
.IR pwcs
points to a null wide-character code), or return the number of column
positions to be occupied by the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR pwcs ,
or return \(mi1 (if any of the first
.IR n
wide-character codes in the wide-character string pointed to by
