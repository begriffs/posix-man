\(em round to nearest integer value using current rounding direction
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall round their argument to the nearest integer
value, rounding according to the current rounding direction.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the rounded
integer value.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a domain error shall occur and an unspecified value is
returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is +Inf, a domain error shall occur and an unspecified value is
returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(miInf, a domain error shall occur and an unspecified value is
returned.
.P
If the correct value is positive and too large to represent as a
.BR long ,
an unspecified value shall be returned.
On systems that support the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, a domain
error shall occur;
otherwise, a
domain
error may occur.
.P
If the correct value is negative and too large to represent as a
.BR long ,
an unspecified value shall be returned.
On systems that support the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, a domain
error shall occur;
otherwise, a
domain
error may occur.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Domain\ Error" 12
The
.IR x
argument is NaN or \(+-Inf, or the correct value is not representable
as an integer.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EDOM] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.P
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Domain\ Error" 12
The correct value is not representable as an integer.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EDOM] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
These functions provide floating-to-integer conversions. They round
according to the current rounding direction. If the rounded value is
outside the range of the return type, the numeric result is unspecified
and the invalid floating-point exception is raised. When they raise no
other floating-point exception and the result differs from the
argument, they raise the inexact floating-point exception.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
