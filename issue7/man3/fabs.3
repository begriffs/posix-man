.SH NAME
fabs,

\(em absolute value function
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute the absolute value of their argument
.IR x ,|\c
.IR x |.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the absolute
value of
.IR x .
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0, +0 shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-Inf, +Inf shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Computing the 1-Norm of a Floating-Point Vector"
.P
This example shows the use of
\fIfabs\fR()
to compute the 1-norm of a vector defined as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
norm1(v) = |v[0]| + |v[1]| + ... + |v[n\(mi1]|
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
where |\fIx\fR| denotes the absolute value of \fIx\fR, \fIn\fR denotes
the vector's dimension \fIv\fR[\fIi\fR] denotes the
.IR i -th
component of \fIv\fR (0\(<=\fIi\fR<\fIn\fR).
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
#include <math.h>
.P
double
norm1(const double v[], const int n)
{
    int     i;
    double  n1_v;  /* 1-norm of v */
.P
    n1_v = 0;
    for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
        n1_v += fabs (v[i]);
    }
.P
    return n1_v;
}
