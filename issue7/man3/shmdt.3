.SH NAME
shmdt
\(em XSI shared memory detach operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/shm.h>
.P
int shmdt(const void *\fIshmaddr\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIshmdt\fR()
function operates on XSI shared memory (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 3.342" ", " "Shared Memory Object").
It is unspecified whether this function interoperates with the
realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in
.IR "Section 2.8" ", " "Realtime".
.P
The
\fIshmdt\fR()
function detaches the shared memory segment located at the address
specified by
.IR shmaddr
from the address space of the calling process.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIshmdt\fR()
shall decrement the value of
.IR shm_nattch
in the data structure associated with the shared memory ID of the
attached shared memory segment and return 0. Also, the
.IR shm_dtime
timestamp shall be set to the current time, as described in
.IR "Section 2.7.1" ", " "IPC General Description".
.P
Otherwise, the shared memory segment shall not be detached,
\fIshmdt\fR()
shall return \(mi1, and
.IR errno
shall be set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIshmdt\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of
.IR shmaddr
is not the data segment start address of a shared memory segment.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The POSIX Realtime Extension defines alternative interfaces for interprocess
communication. Application developers who need to use IPC should
design their applications so that modules using the IPC routines
described in
.IR "Section 2.7" ", " "XSI Interprocess Communication"
can be easily modified to use the alternative interfaces.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
