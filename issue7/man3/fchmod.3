.SH NAME
fchmod
\(em change mode of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/stat.h>
.P
int fchmod(int \fIfildes\fP, mode_t \fImode\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIfchmod\fR()
function shall be equivalent to
\fIchmod\fR()
except that the file whose permissions are changed is specified
by the file descriptor
.IR fildes .
.P
If
.IR fildes
references a shared memory object, the
\fIfchmod\fR()
function need only affect the S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP,
S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH file permission bits.
.P
If
.IR fildes
references a typed memory object, the behavior of
\fIfchmod\fR()
is unspecified.
.P
If
.IR fildes
refers to a socket, the behavior of
\fIfchmod\fR()
is unspecified.
.P
If
.IR fildes
refers to a STREAM (which is
\fIfattach\fR()-ed
into the file system name space) the call returns successfully, doing
nothing.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIfchmod\fR()
shall return 0. Otherwise, it shall return \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIfchmod\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The
.IR fildes
argument is not an open file descriptor.
.TP
.BR EPERM
The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file and the
process does not have appropriate privileges.
.TP
.BR EROFS
The file referred to by
.IR fildes
resides on a read-only file system.
.P
The
\fIfchmod\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINTR
The
\fIfchmod\fR()
function was interrupted by a signal.
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of the
.IR mode
argument is invalid.
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR fildes
argument refers to a pipe and the implementation disallows execution of
\fIfchmod\fR()
on a pipe.
.LP

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Changing the Current Permissions for a File"
.P
The following example shows how to change the permissions for a
file named
.BR /home/cnd/mod1
so that the owner and group have read/write/execute permissions, but
the world only has read/write permissions.
