.SH NAME
sin,
sinf,
sinl
\(em sine function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double sin(double \fIx\fP);
float sinf(float \fIx\fP);
long double sinl(long double \fIx\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute the sine of their argument
.IR x ,
measured in radians.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the sine of
.IR x .
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0,
.IR x
shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is subnormal, a range error may occur
.br
and
.IR x
should be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is not returned,
\fIsin\fR(),
\fIsinf\fR(),
and
\fIsinl\fR()
shall return an implementation-defined value no greater in magnitude
than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-Inf, a domain error shall occur, and a NaN shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Domain\ Error" 12
The
.IR x
argument is \(+-Inf.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EDOM] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.P
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is subnormal
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Taking the Sine of a 45-Degree Angle"
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
#include <math.h>
\&...
double radians = 45.0 * M_PI / 180;

result = sin(radians);
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
These functions may lose accuracy when their argument is near a
multiple of \(*p or is far from 0.0.
.P
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
