.SH NAME
pthread_attr_getschedpolicy,
pthread_attr_setschedpolicy
\(em get and set the schedpolicy attribute
(\fBREALTIME THREADS\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <pthread.h>
.P
int pthread_attr_getschedpolicy(const pthread_attr_t *restrict \fIattr\fP,
    int *restrict \fIpolicy\fP);
int pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(pthread_attr_t *\fIattr\fP, int \fIpolicy\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIpthread_attr_getschedpolicy\fR()
and
\fIpthread_attr_setschedpolicy\fR()
functions, respectively, shall get and set the
.IR schedpolicy
attribute in the
.IR attr
argument.
.P
The supported values of
.IR policy
shall include SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, and SCHED_OTHER,
which are defined in the
.IR <sched.h> 
header. When threads executing with the scheduling policy SCHED_FIFO,
SCHED_RR,
or SCHED_SPORADIC
are waiting on a mutex, they shall acquire the mutex in priority order
when the mutex is unlocked.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_attr_getschedpolicy\fR()
or
\fIpthread_attr_setschedpolicy\fR()
does not refer to an initialized thread attributes object.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If successful, the
\fIpthread_attr_getschedpolicy\fR()
and
\fIpthread_attr_setschedpolicy\fR()
functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIpthread_attr_setschedpolicy\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR ENOTSUP
An attempt was made to set the attribute to an unsupported value.
.P
The
\fIpthread_attr_setschedpolicy\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of
.IR policy
is not valid.
.P
These functions shall not return an error code of
.BR [EINTR] .
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
After these attributes have been set, a thread can be created with the
specified attributes using
\fIpthread_create\fR().
Using these routines does not affect the current running thread.
.P
See
.IR "Section 2.9.4" ", " "Thread Scheduling"
for further details on thread scheduling attributes and their
default settings.
.SH RATIONALE
If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_attr_getschedpolicy\fR()
or
\fIpthread_attr_setschedpolicy\fR()
does not refer to an initialized thread attributes object, it is
recommended that the function should fail and report an
.BR [EINVAL] 
error.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
