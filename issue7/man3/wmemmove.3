.SH NAME
wmemmove
\(em copy wide characters in memory with overlapping areas
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>
.P
wchar_t *wmemmove(wchar_t *\fIws1\fP, const wchar_t *\fIws2\fP, size_t \fIn\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIwmemmove\fR()
function shall copy
.IR n
wide characters from the object pointed to by
.IR ws2
to the object pointed to by
.IR ws1 .
Copying shall take place as if the
.IR n
wide characters from the object pointed to by
.IR ws2
are first copied into a temporary array of
.IR n
wide characters that does not overlap the objects pointed to by
.IR ws1
or
.IR ws2 ,
and then the
.IR n
wide characters from the temporary array are copied into the object
pointed to by
.IR ws1 .
.P
This function shall not be affected by locale and all
.BR wchar_t
values shall be treated identically. The null wide character and
.BR wchar_t
values not corresponding to valid characters shall not be treated
specially.
.P
If
.IR n
is zero, the application shall ensure that
.IR ws1
and
.IR ws2
are valid pointers, and the function shall copy zero wide characters.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIwmemmove\fR()
function shall return the value of
.IR ws1 .
