\(em get and set floating-point status flags
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <fenv.h>
.P
int fegetexceptflag(fexcept_t *\fIflagp\fP, int \fIexcepts\fP);
int fesetexceptflag(const fexcept_t *\fIflagp\fP, int \fIexcepts\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIfegetexceptflag\fR()
function shall attempt to store an implementation-defined representation
of the states of the floating-point status flags indicated by the argument
.IR excepts
in the object pointed to by the argument
.IR flagp .
.P
The
\fIfesetexceptflag\fR()
function shall attempt to set the floating-point status flags indicated
by the argument
.IR excepts
to the states stored in the object pointed to by
.IR flagp .
The value pointed to by
.IR flagp
shall have been set by a previous call to
\fIfegetexceptflag\fR()
whose second argument represented at least those floating-point
exceptions represented by the argument
.IR excepts .
This function does not raise floating-point exceptions, but only sets
the state of the flags.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If the representation was successfully stored,
\fIfegetexceptflag\fR()
shall return zero. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value. If the
.IR excepts
argument is zero or if all the specified exceptions were successfully
set,
\fIfesetexceptflag\fR()
shall return zero. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
