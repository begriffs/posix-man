.SH NAME
nearbyint,
nearbyintf,
nearbyintl
\(em floating-point rounding functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double nearbyint(double \fIx\fP);
float nearbyintf(float \fIx\fP);
long double nearbyintl(long double \fIx\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall round their argument to an integer value in
floating-point format, using the current rounding direction and without
raising the inexact floating-point exception.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the rounded
integer value.
The result shall have the same sign as
.IR x .
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0, \(+-0 shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-Inf,
.IR x
shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The integral value returned by these functions need not be expressible
as an
.BR intmax_t .
The return value should be tested before assigning it to an integer
type to avoid the undefined results of an integer overflow.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
