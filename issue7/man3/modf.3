.SH NAME
modf,
modff,
modfl
\(em decompose a floating-point number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double modf(double \fIx\fP, double *\fIiptr\fP);
float modff(float \fIvalue\fP, float *\fIiptr\fP);
long double modfl(long double \fIvalue\fP, long double *\fIiptr\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall break the argument
.IR x
into integral and fractional parts, each of which has the same sign as
the argument. It stores the integral part as a
.BR double
(for the
\fImodf\fR()
function), a
.BR float
(for the
\fImodff\fR()
function), or a
.BR "long double"
(for the
\fImodfl\fR()
function), in the object pointed to by
.IR iptr .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the signed
fractional part of
.IR x .
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned, and *\fIiptr\fP shall be set to a
NaN.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-Inf, \(+-0 shall be returned, and *\fIiptr\fP shall be set to
\(+-Inf.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fImodf\fR()
function computes the function result and *\fIiptr\fP such that:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
a = modf(x, iptr) ;
x == a+*iptr ;
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
allowing for the usual floating-point inaccuracies.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
