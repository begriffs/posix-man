.SH NAME
encrypt
\(em encoding function
(\fBCRYPT\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>
.P
void encrypt(char \fIblock\fP[64], int \fIedflag\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIencrypt\fR()
function shall provide access to an implementation-defined encoding
algorithm. The key generated by
\fIsetkey\fR()
is used to encrypt the string
.IR block
with
\fIencrypt\fR().
.P
The
.IR block
argument to
\fIencrypt\fR()
shall be an array of length 64 bytes containing only the bytes with
values of 0 and 1. The array is modified in place to a similar
array using the key set by
\fIsetkey\fR().
If
.IR edflag
is 0, the argument is encoded. If
.IR edflag
is 1, the argument may be decoded (see the APPLICATION USAGE section);
if the argument is not decoded,
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ENOSYS] .
.P
The
\fIencrypt\fR()
function shall not change the setting of
.IR errno
if successful. An application wishing to check for error situations
should set
.IR errno
to 0 before calling
\fIencrypt\fR().
If
.IR errno
is non-zero on return, an error has occurred.
.P
The
\fIencrypt\fR()
function need not be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIencrypt\fR()
function shall not return a value.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIencrypt\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR ENOSYS
The functionality is not supported on this implementation.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Historical implementations of the
\fIencrypt\fR()
function used a rather primitive encoding algorithm.
.P
In some environments, decoding might not be implemented. This is
related to some Government restrictions on encryption and decryption
routines. Historical practice has been to ship a different version of
the encryption library without the decryption feature in the routines
supplied. Thus the exported version of
\fIencrypt\fR()
does encoding but not decoding.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
