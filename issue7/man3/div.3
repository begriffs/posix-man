.SH NAME
div
\(em compute the quotient and remainder of an integer division
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
div_t div(int \fInumer\fP, int \fIdenom\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIdiv\fR()
function shall compute the quotient and remainder of the division
of the numerator
.IR numer
by the denominator
.IR denom .
If the division is inexact, the resulting quotient is the integer of
lesser magnitude that is the nearest to the algebraic quotient. If the
result cannot be represented, the behavior is undefined; otherwise,
.IR quot *\c
.IR denom +\c
.IR rem
shall equal
.IR numer .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIdiv\fR()
function shall return a structure of type
.BR div_t ,
comprising both the quotient and the remainder. The structure includes
the following members, in any order:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
int  quot;  /* quotient */
int  rem;   /* remainder */
.fi \fR
