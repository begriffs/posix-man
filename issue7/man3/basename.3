.SH NAME
basename
\(em return the last component of a pathname
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <libgen.h>
.P
char *basename(char *\fIpath\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIbasename\fR()
function shall take the pathname pointed to by
.IR path
and return a pointer to the final component of the pathname, deleting
any trailing
.BR '/' 
characters.
.P
If the string pointed to by
.IR path
consists entirely of the
.BR '/' 
character,
\fIbasename\fR()
shall return a pointer to the string
.BR \(dq/\(dq .
If the string pointed to by
.IR path
is exactly
.BR \(dq//\(dq ,
it is implementation-defined whether
.BR '/' 
or
.BR \(dq//\(dq 
is returned.
.P
If
.IR path
is a null pointer or points to an empty string,
\fIbasename\fR()
shall return a pointer to the string
.BR \(dq.\(dq .
.P
The
\fIbasename\fR()
function may modify the string pointed to by
.IR path ,
and may return a pointer to internal storage. The returned pointer might
be invalidated or the storage might be overwritten by a subsequent call to
\fIbasename\fR().
.P
The
\fIbasename\fR()
function need not be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIbasename\fR()
function shall return a pointer to the final component of
.IR path .
