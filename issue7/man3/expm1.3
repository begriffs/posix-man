.SH NAME
expm1,

expm1l
\(em compute exponential functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double expm1(double \fIx\fP);
float expm1f(float \fIx\fP);
long double expm1l(long double \fIx\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute \fIe\u\s-3x\s+3\d\fR\(mi1.0.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions return
\fIe\s-3\ux\d\s+3\fR\(mi1.0.
.P
If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error shall occur
and
\fIexpm1\fR(),
\fIexpm1f\fR(),
and
\fIexpm1l\fR()
shall return the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, and HUGE_VALL,
respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0, \(+-0 shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(miInf, \(mi1 shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is +Inf,
.IR x
shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is subnormal, a range error may occur
.br
and
.IR x
should be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is not returned,
\fIexpm1\fR(),
\fIexpm1f\fR(),
and
\fIexpm1l\fR()
shall return an implementation-defined value no greater in magnitude
than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result overflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.P
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is subnormal.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.

.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The value of
.IR expm1 ( x )
may be more accurate than
.IR exp ( x )\(mi1.0
for small values of
.IR x .
.P
The
\fIexpm1\fR()
and
\fIlog1p\fR()
functions are useful for financial calculations of
((1+\fIx\fR)\u\s-3\fIn\fR\s+3\d\(mi1)/\fIx\fR, namely:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
expm1(\fIn\fP * log1p(\fIx\fP))/\fIx\fP
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
when
.IR x
is very small (for example, when calculating small daily interest
rates). These functions also simplify writing accurate inverse
hyperbolic functions.
.P
For IEEE\ Std\ 754\(hy1985
.BR double ,
709.8 <
.IR x
implies
.IR expm1 (\c
.IR x )
has overflowed.
.P
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
