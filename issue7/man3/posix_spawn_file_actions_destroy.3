.SH NAME
posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy,
posix_spawn_file_actions_init
\(em destroy and initialize spawn file actions object
(\fBADVANCED REALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>
.P
int posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy(posix_spawn_file_actions_t
    *\fIfile_actions\fP);
int posix_spawn_file_actions_init(posix_spawn_file_actions_t
    *\fIfile_actions\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy\fR()
function shall destroy the object referenced by
.IR file_actions ;
the object becomes, in effect, uninitialized. An implementation may
cause
\fIposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy\fR()
to set the object referenced by
.IR file_actions
to an invalid value. A destroyed spawn file actions object can be
reinitialized using
\fIposix_spawn_file_actions_init\fR();
the results of otherwise referencing the object after it has been
destroyed are undefined.
.P
The
\fIposix_spawn_file_actions_init\fR()
function shall initialize the object referenced by
.IR file_actions
to contain no file actions for
\fIposix_spawn\fR()
or
\fIposix_spawnp\fR()
to perform.
.P
A spawn file actions object is as defined in
.IR "\fIposix_spawn_file_actions_addclose\fR\^(\|)".
.P
The effect of initializing an already initialized spawn file actions
object is undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIposix_spawn_file_actions_init\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the spawn file actions object.
.P
The
\fIposix_spawn_file_actions_destroy\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value specified by
.IR file_actions
is invalid.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
These functions are part of the Spawn option and need not be
provided on all implementations.
.SH RATIONALE
Refer to the RATIONALE section in
.IR "\fIposix_spawn_file_actions_addclose\fR\^(\|)".
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
