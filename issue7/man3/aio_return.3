.SH NAME
aio_return
\(em retrieve return status of an asynchronous I/O operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <aio.h>
.P
ssize_t aio_return(struct aiocb *\fIaiocbp\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIaio_return\fR()
function shall return the return status associated with the
.BR aiocb
structure referenced by the
.IR aiocbp
argument. The return status for an asynchronous I/O operation is the
value that would be returned by the corresponding
\fIread\fR(),
\fIwrite\fR(),
or
\fIfsync\fR()
function call. If the error status for the operation is equal to
.BR [EINPROGRESS] ,
then the return status for the operation is undefined. The
\fIaio_return\fR()
function may be called exactly once to retrieve the return status of a
given asynchronous operation; thereafter, if the same
.BR aiocb
structure is used in a call to
\fIaio_return\fR()
or
\fIaio_error\fR(),
an error may be returned. When the
.BR aiocb
structure referred to by
.IR aiocbp
is used to submit another asynchronous operation, then
\fIaio_return\fR()
may be successfully used to retrieve the return status of that
operation.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If the asynchronous I/O operation has completed, then the return
status, as described for
\fIread\fR(),
\fIwrite\fR(),
and
\fIfsync\fR(),
shall be returned. If the asynchronous I/O operation has not yet
completed, the results of
\fIaio_return\fR()
are undefined.
.P
If the
\fIaio_return\fR()
function fails, it shall return \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIaio_return\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR aiocbp
argument does not refer to an asynchronous operation whose return
status has not yet been retrieved.
