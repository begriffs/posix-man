.SH NAME
posix_trace_clear
\(em clear trace stream and trace log
(\fBTRACING\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <trace.h>
.P
int posix_trace_clear(trace_id_t \fItrid\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIposix_trace_clear\fR()
function shall reinitialize the trace stream identified by the argument
.IR trid
as if it were returning from the
\fIposix_trace_create\fR()
function, except that the same allocated resources shall be reused, the
mapping of trace event type identifiers to trace event names shall be
unchanged, and the trace stream status shall remain unchanged (that is,
if it was running, it remains running and if it was suspended, it
remains suspended).
.P
All trace events in the trace stream recorded before the call to
\fIposix_trace_clear\fR()
shall be lost. The
.IR posix_stream_full_status
status shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL.
There is no guarantee that all trace events that occurred during the
\fIposix_trace_clear\fR()
call are recorded; the behavior with respect to trace points that may
occur during this call is unspecified.
.P
If the Trace Log option is supported and the trace stream has been
created with a log, the
\fIposix_trace_clear\fR()
function shall reinitialize the trace stream with the same behavior as
if the trace stream was created without the log, plus it shall
reinitialize the trace log associated with the trace stream identified
by the argument
.IR trid
as if it were returning from the
\fIposix_trace_create_withlog\fR()
function, except that the same allocated resources, for the trace log,
may be reused and the associated trace stream status remains unchanged.
The first trace event recorded in the trace log after the call to
\fIposix_trace_clear\fR()
shall be the same as the first trace event recorded in the active trace
stream after the call to
\fIposix_trace_clear\fR().
The
.IR posix_log_full_status
status shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL. There is no guarantee
that all trace events that occurred during the
\fIposix_trace_clear\fR()
call are recorded in the trace log; the behavior with respect to trace
points that may occur during this call is unspecified. If the log full
policy is POSIX_TRACE_APPEND, the effect of a call to this function is
unspecified for the trace log associated with the trace stream
identified by the
.IR trid
argument.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIposix_trace_clear\fR()
function shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, it shall return the
corresponding error number.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIposix_trace_clear\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of the
.IR trid
argument does not correspond to an active trace stream.
