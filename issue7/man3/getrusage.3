.SH NAME
getrusage
\(em get information about resource utilization
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/resource.h>
.P
int getrusage(int \fIwho\fP, struct rusage *\fIr_usage\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIgetrusage\fR()
function shall provide measures of the resources used by the current
process or its terminated and waited-for child processes. If the value
of the
.IR who
argument is RUSAGE_SELF, information shall be returned about resources
used by the current process. If the value of the
.IR who
argument is RUSAGE_CHILDREN,
information shall be returned about resources used by the terminated and
waited-for children of the current process. If the child is never
waited for (for example, if the parent has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or sets
SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN), the resource
information for the child process is discarded and not included in the
resource information provided by
\fIgetrusage\fR().
.P
The
.IR r_usage
argument is a pointer to an object of type
.BR "struct rusage"
in which the returned information is stored.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIgetrusage\fR()
shall return 0; otherwise, \(mi1 shall be returned and
.IR errno
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIgetrusage\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of the
.IR who
argument is not valid.
