.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fItcgetpgrp\fR()
function shall return the value of the process group ID of the
foreground process group associated with the terminal.

shall return a value greater than 1 that does not match the process
group ID of any existing process group.

function is allowed from a process that is a member of a background
process group; however, the information may be subsequently changed by
a process that is a member of a foreground process group.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fItcgetpgrp\fR()
shall return the value of the process group ID of the foreground
process associated with the terminal. Otherwise, \(mi1 shall be
returned and
.IR errno
set to indicate the error.
