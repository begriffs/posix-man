.SH NAME
errno
\(em error return value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <errno.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The lvalue
.IR errno
is used by many functions to return error values.
.P
Many functions provide an error number in
.IR errno ,
which has type
.BR int
and is defined in
.IR <errno.h> .
The value of
.IR errno
shall be defined only after a call to a function for which it is
explicitly stated to be set and until it is changed by the next
function call or if the application assigns it a value. The value of
.IR errno
should only be examined when it is indicated to be valid by a
function's return value. Applications shall obtain the definition of
.IR errno
by the inclusion of
.IR <errno.h> .
No function in this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 shall set
.IR errno
to 0. The setting of
.IR errno
after a successful call to a function is unspecified unless the
description of that function specifies that
.IR errno
shall not be modified.
.P
It is unspecified whether
.IR errno
is a macro or an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro
definition is suppressed in order to access an actual object, or a
program defines an identifier with the name
.IR errno ,
the behavior is undefined.
.P
The symbolic values stored in
.IR errno
are documented in the ERRORS sections on all relevant pages.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
None.
.SH ERRORS
None.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Previously both POSIX and X/Open documents were more restrictive than
the ISO\ C standard in that they required
.IR errno
to be defined as an external variable, whereas the ISO\ C standard required only
that
.IR errno
be defined as a modifiable lvalue with type
.BR int .
.P
An application that needs to examine the value of
.IR errno
to determine the error should set it to 0 before a function call, then
inspect it before a subsequent function call.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
