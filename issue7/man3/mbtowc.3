.SH NAME
mbtowc
\(em convert a character to a wide-character code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
int mbtowc(wchar_t *restrict \fIpwc\fP, const char *restrict \fIs\fP, size_t \fIn\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
If
.IR s
is not a null pointer,
\fImbtowc\fR()
shall determine the number of bytes that constitute the character
pointed to by
.IR s .
It shall then determine the wide-character code for the value of type
.BR wchar_t
that corresponds to that character. (The value of the wide-character
code corresponding to the null byte is 0.) If the character is valid
and
.IR pwc
is not a null pointer,
\fImbtowc\fR()
shall store the wide-character code in the object pointed to by
.IR pwc .
.P
The behavior of this function is affected by the
.IR LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale. For a state-dependent encoding, this
function is placed into its initial state by a call for which its
character pointer argument,
.IR s ,
is a null pointer. Subsequent calls with
.IR s
as other than a null pointer shall cause the internal state of the
function to be altered as necessary. A call with
.IR s
as a null pointer shall cause this function to return a non-zero value
if encodings have state dependency, and 0 otherwise. If the
implementation employs special bytes to change the shift state, these
bytes shall not produce separate wide-character codes, but shall be
grouped with an adjacent character. Changing the
.IR LC_CTYPE
category causes the shift state of this function to be unspecified. At
most
.IR n
bytes of the array pointed to by
.IR s
shall be examined.
.P
The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 calls
\fImbtowc\fR().
.P
The
\fImbtowc\fR()
function need not be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If
.IR s
is a null pointer,
\fImbtowc\fR()
shall return a non-zero or 0 value, if character encodings, respectively,
do or do not have state-dependent encodings. If
.IR s
is not a null pointer,
\fImbtowc\fR()
shall either return 0 (if
.IR s
points to the null byte), or return the number of bytes that constitute
the converted character (if the next
.IR n
or fewer bytes form a valid character), or return \(mi1
and shall set
.IR errno
to indicate the error
(if they do not form a valid character).
.P
In no case shall the value returned be greater than
.IR n
or the value of the
{MB_CUR_MAX}
macro.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fImbtowc\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EILSEQ
An invalid character sequence is detected.
