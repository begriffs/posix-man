.LP
.nf
#include <sched.h>
.P
int sched_getscheduler(pid_t \fIpid\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIsched_getscheduler\fR()
function shall return the scheduling policy of the process specified by
.IR pid .
If the value of
.IR pid
is negative, the behavior of the
\fIsched_getscheduler\fR()
function is unspecified.
.P
The values that can be returned by
\fIsched_getscheduler\fR()
are defined in the
.IR <sched.h> 
header.
.P
If a process specified by
.IR pid
exists, and if the calling process has permission, the scheduling
policy shall be returned for the process whose process ID is equal to
.IR pid .
.P
If
.IR pid
is zero, the scheduling policy shall be returned for the calling process.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIsched_getscheduler\fR()
function shall return the scheduling policy of the specified process.
If unsuccessful, the function shall return \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIsched_getscheduler\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EPERM
The requesting process does not have permission to determine the
