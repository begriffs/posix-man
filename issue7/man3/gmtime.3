.SH NAME
gmtime,
gmtime_r
\(em convert a time value to a broken-down UTC time
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <time.h>
.P
struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *\fItimer\fP);
struct tm *gmtime_r(const time_t *restrict \fItimer\fP,
    struct tm *restrict \fIresult\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fIgmtime\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIgmtime\fR()
function shall convert the time in seconds since the Epoch pointed to by
.IR timer
into a broken-down time, expressed as Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC).
.P
The relationship between a time in seconds since the Epoch used as an
argument to
\fIgmtime\fR()
and the
.BR tm
structure (defined in the
.IR <time.h> 
header) is that the result shall be as specified in the expression
given in the definition of seconds since the Epoch (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Section 4.15" ", " "Seconds Since the Epoch"),
where the names in the structure and in the expression correspond.
.P
The same relationship shall apply for
\fIgmtime_r\fR().
.P
The
\fIgmtime\fR()
function need not be thread-safe.
.P
The
\fIasctime\fR(),
\fIctime\fR(),
\fIgmtime\fR(),
and
\fIlocaltime\fR()
functions shall return values in one of two static objects: a
broken-down time structure and an array of type
.BR char .
Execution of any of the functions may overwrite the information
returned in either of these objects by any of the other functions.
.P
The
\fIgmtime_r\fR()
function shall convert the time in seconds since the Epoch pointed to by
.IR timer
into a broken-down time expressed as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
The broken-down time is stored in the structure referred to by
.IR result .
The
\fIgmtime_r\fR()
function shall also return the address of the same structure.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIgmtime\fR()
function shall return a pointer to a
.BR "struct tm" .
If an error is detected,
\fIgmtime\fR()
shall return a null pointer
and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.P
Upon successful completion,
\fIgmtime_r\fR()
shall return the address of the structure pointed to by the argument
.IR result .
If an error is detected,
\fIgmtime_r\fR()
shall return a null pointer and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIgmtime\fR()
and
\fIgmtime_r\fR()
functions shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EOVERFLOW
The result cannot be represented.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIgmtime_r\fR()
function is thread-safe and returns values in a user-supplied buffer
instead of possibly using a static data area that may be overwritten by
each call.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
