.LP
.nf
#include <pthread.h>
#include <time.h>
.P
int pthread_getcpuclockid(pthread_t \fIthread_id\fP, clockid_t *\fIclock_id\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIpthread_getcpuclockid\fR()
function shall return in
.IR clock_id
the clock ID of the CPU-time clock of the thread specified by
.IR thread_id ,
if the thread specified by
.IR thread_id
exists.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIpthread_getcpuclockid\fR()

lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
.BR [ESRCH] 
error.
