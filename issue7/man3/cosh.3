.SH NAME
cosh,
coshf,
coshl
\(em hyperbolic cosine functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double cosh(double \fIx\fP);
float coshf(float \fIx\fP);
long double coshl(long double \fIx\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute the hyperbolic cosine of their argument
.IR x .
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the hyperbolic
cosine of
.IR x .
.P
If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error shall occur
and
\fIcosh\fR(),
\fIcoshf\fR(),
and
\fIcoshl\fR()
shall return the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, and HUGE_VALL,
respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0, the value 1.0 shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-Inf, +Inf shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result would cause an overflow.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.P
For IEEE\ Std\ 754\(hy1985
.BR double ,
710.5 < |\fIx\fP| implies that
.IR cosh (\c
.IR x )
has overflowed.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
