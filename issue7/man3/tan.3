.SH NAME
tan,
tanf,
tanl
\(em tangent function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double tan(double \fIx\fP);
float tanf(float \fIx\fP);
long double tanl(long double \fIx\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute the tangent of their argument
.IR x ,
measured in radians.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the tangent of
.IR x .
.P
If the correct value would cause underflow,
and is not representable,
a range error may occur, and
\fItan\fR(),
\fItanf\fR(),
and
\fItanl\fR()
shall return
0.0, or
(if IEC 60559 Floating-Point is not supported) an implementation-defined
value no greater in magnitude than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN,
respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0,
.IR x
shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is subnormal, a range error may occur
.br
and
.IR x
should be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is not returned,
\fItan\fR(),
\fItanf\fR(),
and
\fItanl\fR()
shall return an implementation-defined value no greater in magnitude
than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-Inf, a domain error shall occur, and either a NaN (if
supported), or an implementation-defined value shall be returned.
.P
If the correct value would cause underflow, and is representable,
a range error may occur and the correct value shall be returned.
.P
If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error shall occur
and
\fItan\fR(),
\fItanf\fR(),
and
\fItanl\fR()
shall return \(+-HUGE_VAL, \(+-HUGE_VALF, and \(+-HUGE_VALL,
respectively, with the same sign as the correct value of the function.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Domain\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is \(+-Inf.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EDOM] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result overflows
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.br
.P
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result underflows,
or the value of
.IR x
is subnormal.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.

.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
There are no known floating-point representations such that for a
normal argument,
.IR tan (\c
.IR x )
is either overflow or underflow.
.P
These functions may lose accuracy when their argument is near a
multiple of \(*p/2 or is far from 0.0.
.P
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
