.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wctype.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fItowupper\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fItowupper\fR()
and
\fItowupper_l\fR()
functions have as a domain a type
.BR wint_t ,
the value of which the application shall ensure is a character
representable as a
.BR wchar_t ,
and a wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in the
current locale or the value of WEOF.
If the argument has any other value, the behavior is undefined.
If the argument of
\fItowupper\fR()
or
\fItowupper_l\fR()
represents a lowercase wide-character code, and there exists a
corresponding uppercase wide-character code as defined by character
type information in the current locale
or in the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively (category
.IR LC_CTYPE ),
the result shall be the corresponding uppercase wide-character code.
All other arguments in the domain are returned unchanged.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the
.IR locale
argument to
\fItowupper_l\fR()
is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
object handle.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fItowupper\fR()
and
\fItowupper_l\fR()
functions shall return the uppercase letter corresponding to the
argument passed. Otherwise, they shall return the argument unchanged.
