.SH NAME
erf,
erff,
erfl
\(em error functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double erf(double \fIx\fP);
float erff(float \fIx\fP);
long double erfl(long double \fIx\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute the error function of their argument
.IR x ,
defined as:
.sp
.RS
${2 over sqrt pi} int from 0 to x e"^" " "{- t"^" 2" "} dt$
.RE
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the value of
the error function.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0, \(+-0 shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-Inf, \(+-1 shall be returned.
.P
If the correct value would cause underflow, a range error may occur, and
\fIerf\fR(),
\fIerff\fR(),
and
\fIerfl\fR()
shall return an implementation-defined value no greater in magnitude
than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.
.P
If the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option is supported, 2 *
.IR x /\c
.IR sqrt (\(*p)
should be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result underflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.br
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Computing the Probability for a Normal Variate"
.P
This example shows how to use
\fIerf\fR()
to compute the probability that a normal variate assumes a value in the
range [\fIx\fR1,\fIx\fR2] with \fIx\fR1\(<=\fIx\fR2.
.P
This example uses the constant M_SQRT1_2 which is part of the XSI option.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
#include <math.h>
.P
double
Phi(const double x1, const double x2)
{
    return ( erf(x2*M_SQRT1_2) \(mi erf(x1*M_SQRT1_2) ) / 2;
}
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Underflow occurs when |\fIx\fP| < DBL_MIN * (\c
.IR sqrt (\(*p)/2).
.P
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
