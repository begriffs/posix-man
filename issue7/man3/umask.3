.SH NAME
umask
\(em set and get the file mode creation mask
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/stat.h>
.P
mode_t umask(mode_t \fIcmask\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIumask\fR()
function shall set the file mode creation mask of the process to
.IR cmask
and return the previous value of the mask. Only the file permission
bits of
.IR cmask
(see
.IR <sys/stat.h> )
are used; the meaning of the other bits is implementation-defined.
.P
The file mode creation mask of the process is used to turn off
permission bits in the
.IR mode
argument supplied during calls to the following functions:
.IP " *" 4
\fIopen\fR(),
\fIopenat\fR(),
\fIcreat\fR(),
\fImkdir\fR(),
\fImkdirat\fR(),
\fImkfifo\fR(),
and
\fImkfifoat\fR()
.IP " *" 4
\fImknod\fR(),
\fImknodat\fR()
.IP " *" 4
\fImq_open\fR()
.IP " *" 4
\fIsem_open\fR()
.P
Bit positions that are set in
.IR cmask
are cleared in the mode of the created file.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The file permission bits in the value returned by
\fIumask\fR()
shall be the previous value of the file mode creation mask. The state
of any other bits in that value is unspecified, except that a
subsequent call to
\fIumask\fR()
with the returned value as
.IR cmask
shall leave the state of the mask the same as its state before the
first call, including any unspecified use of those bits.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
Unsigned argument and return types for
\fIumask\fR()
were proposed. The return type and the argument were both changed to
.BR mode_t .
.P
Historical implementations have made use of additional bits in
.IR cmask
for their implementation-defined purposes. The addition of the text
that the meaning of other bits of the field is implementation-defined
permits these implementations to conform to this volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
