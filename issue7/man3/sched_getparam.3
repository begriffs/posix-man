.SH NAME
sched_getparam
\(em get scheduling parameters
(\fBREALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sched.h>
.P
int sched_getparam(pid_t \fIpid\fP, struct sched_param *\fIparam\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIsched_getparam\fR()
function shall return the scheduling parameters of a process specified by
.IR pid
in the
.BR sched_param
structure pointed to by
.IR param .
.P
If a process specified by
.IR pid
exists, and if the calling process has permission, the scheduling
parameters for the process whose process ID is equal to
.IR pid
shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR pid
is zero, the scheduling parameters for the calling process shall be
returned. The behavior of the
\fIsched_getparam\fR()
function is unspecified if the value of
.IR pid
is negative.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIsched_getparam\fR()
function shall return zero. If the call to
\fIsched_getparam\fR()
is unsuccessful, the function shall return a value of \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIsched_getparam\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EPERM
The requesting process does not have permission to obtain the
scheduling parameters of the specified process.
.TP
.BR ESRCH
No process can be found corresponding to that specified by
.IR pid .
