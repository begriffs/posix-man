\(em log gamma function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>

float lgammaf(float \fIx\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute
$log_ e" " \(br \(*G ( ^ x ) \(br$
where $\(*G ( ^ x )$ is defined as
$int from 0 to inf e"^" " "{ - t } t"^" " "{ x - 1 } dt$.
The argument
.IR x
need not be a non-positive integer ($\(*G( ^ x )$ is defined over
the reals, except the non-positive integers).
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, \(miInf, or a negative integer, the value of
.IR signgam
is unspecified.
.P
These functions need not be thread-safe.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the
logarithmic gamma of
.IR x .
.P
If
.IR x
is a non-positive integer, a pole error shall occur and
\fIlgamma\fR(),
\fIlgammaf\fR(),
and
\fIlgammal\fR()
shall return +HUGE_VAL, +HUGE_VALF, and +HUGE_VALL, respectively.
.P
If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error shall occur
and
\fIlgamma\fR(),
\fIlgammaf\fR(),
and
\fIlgammal\fR()
shall return \(+-HUGE_VAL, \(+-HUGE_VALF, and \(+-HUGE_VALL (having the
same sign as the correct value), respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is 1 or 2, +0 shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-Inf, +Inf shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Pole\ Error" 12
The
.IR x
argument is a negative integer or zero.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the divide-by-zero floating-point exception shall be
raised.
.RE
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result overflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
