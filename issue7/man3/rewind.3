.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.

.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
except that
\fIrewind\fR()
shall also clear the error indicator.
.P
Since
\fIrewind\fR()
does not return a value, an application wishing to detect errors should
clear
.IR errno ,
then call
\fIrewind\fR(),
and if
.IR errno
is non-zero, assume an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIrewind\fR()
function shall not return a value.
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIfseek\fR\^(\|)"
with the exception of
