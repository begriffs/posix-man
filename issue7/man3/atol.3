.SH NAME
atol,

\(em convert a string to a long integer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
long atol(const char *\fIstr\fP);
long long atoll(const char *\fInptr\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.

except that the handling of errors may differ. If the value cannot be
represented, the behavior is undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
These functions shall return the converted value if the value can be
represented.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIatol\fR()
function is subsumed by
\fIstrtol\fR()
but is retained because it is used extensively in existing code. If the
number is not known to be in range,
\fIstrtol\fR()
should be used because
\fIatol\fR()
is not required to perform any error checking.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
