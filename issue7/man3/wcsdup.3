.nf
#include <wchar.h>
.P
wchar_t *wcsdup(const wchar_t *\fIstring\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIwcsdup\fR()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
\fIstrdup\fR()
function.
.P
The
\fIwcsdup\fR()
function shall return a pointer to a new wide-character string,
allocated as if by a call to
\fImalloc\fR(),
which is the duplicate of the wide-character string
.IR string .
The returned pointer can be passed to
\fIfree\fR().
A null pointer is returned if the new wide-character string cannot be
created.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIwcsdup\fR()
function shall return a pointer to the newly allocated wide-character
string. Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIwcsdup\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
Memory large enough for the duplicate string could not be allocated.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
For functions that allocate memory as if by
\fImalloc\fR(),
the application should release such memory when it is no longer
required by a call to
\fIfree\fR().
For
\fIwcsdup\fR(),
this is the return value.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
