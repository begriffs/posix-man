.SH NAME
chdir
\(em change working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>
.P
int chdir(const char *\fIpath\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIchdir\fR()
function shall cause the directory named by the pathname pointed to
by the
.IR path
argument to become the current working directory; that is, the starting
point for path searches for pathnames not beginning with
.BR '/' .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, \(mi1 shall
be returned, the current working directory shall remain unchanged, and
.IR errno
shall be set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIchdir\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EACCES
Search permission is denied for any component of the pathname.
.TP
.BR ELOOP
A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
.IR path
argument.
.TP
.BR ENAMETOOLONG
.br
The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
{NAME_MAX}.
.TP
.BR ENOENT
A component of
.IR path
does not name an existing directory or
.IR path
is an empty string.
.TP
.BR ENOTDIR
A component of the pathname names an existing file that is neither
a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.
.P
The
\fIchdir\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR ELOOP
More than
{SYMLOOP_MAX}
symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the
.IR path
argument.
.TP
.BR ENAMETOOLONG
.br
The length of a pathname exceeds
{PATH_MAX},
or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
result with a length that exceeds
{PATH_MAX}.
.LP

.BR directory ,
.BR /tmp ,
the current working directory.
