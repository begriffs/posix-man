.SH NAME
endhostent,
gethostent,
sethostent
\(em network host database functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <netdb.h>
.P
void endhostent(void);
struct hostent *gethostent(void);
void sethostent(int \fIstayopen\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions shall retrieve information about hosts. This
information is considered to be stored in a database that can be
accessed sequentially or randomly. The implementation of this database
is unspecified.
.TP 10
.BR Note:
In many cases this database is implemented by the Domain Name System,
as documented in RFC\ 1034, RFC\ 1035, and RFC\ 1886.
.P
.P
The
\fIsethostent\fR()
function shall open a connection to the database and set the next entry
for retrieval to the first entry in the database. If the
.IR stayopen
argument is non-zero, the connection shall not be closed by a call to
\fIgethostent\fR(),
and the implementation may maintain an open file descriptor.
.P
The
\fIgethostent\fR()
function shall read the next entry in the database, opening and closing
a connection to the database as necessary.
.P
Entries shall be returned in
.BR hostent
structures.
.P
The
\fIendhostent\fR()
function shall close the connection to the database, releasing any open
file descriptor.
.P
These functions need not be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIgethostent\fR()
function shall return a pointer to a
.BR hostent
structure if the requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the
end of the database was reached or the requested entry was not found.
.P
The application shall not modify the structure to which the return
value points, nor any storage areas pointed to by pointers within the
structure. The returned pointer, and pointers within the structure,
might be invalidated or the structure or the storage areas might be
overwritten by a subsequent call to
\fIgethostent\fR().
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined for
\fIendhostent\fR(),
\fIgethostent\fR(),
and
\fIsethostent\fR().
