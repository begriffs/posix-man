.SH NAME
catgets
\(em read a program message
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <nl_types.h>
.P
char *catgets(nl_catd \fIcatd\fP, int \fIset_id\fP, int \fImsg_id\fP, const char *\fIs\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIcatgets\fR()
function shall attempt to read message
.IR msg_id ,
in set
.IR set_id ,
from the message catalog identified by
.IR catd .
The
.IR catd
argument is a message catalog descriptor returned from an earlier call
to
\fIcatopen\fR().
The results are undefined if
.IR catd
is not a value returned by
\fIcatopen\fR()
for a message catalog still open in the process. The
.IR s
argument points to a default message string which shall be returned by
\fIcatgets\fR()
if it cannot retrieve the identified message.
.P
The
\fIcatgets\fR()
function need not be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If the identified message is retrieved successfully,
\fIcatgets\fR()
shall return a pointer to an internal buffer area containing the
null-terminated message string. If the call is unsuccessful for any
reason,
.IR s
shall be returned and
.IR errno
shall be set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIcatgets\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EINTR
The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and
no data was transferred.
.TP
.BR ENOMSG
The message identified by
.IR set_id
and
.IR msg_id
is not in the message catalog.
.P
The
\fIcatgets\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The
.IR catd
argument is not a valid message catalog descriptor open for reading.
.TP
.BR EBADMSG
The message identified by
.IR set_id
and
.IR msg_id
in the specified message catalog did not satisfy implementation-defined
security criteria.
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The message catalog identified by
.IR catd
is corrupted.
