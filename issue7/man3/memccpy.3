.SH NAME
memccpy

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <string.h>
.P
void *memccpy(void *restrict \fIs1\fP, const void *restrict \fIs2\fP,
    int \fIc\fP, size_t \fIn\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fImemccpy\fR()
function shall copy bytes from memory area
.IR s2
into
.IR s1 ,
stopping after the first occurrence of byte
.IR c
(converted to an
.BR "unsigned char" )
is copied, or after
.IR n
bytes are copied, whichever comes first. If copying takes place
between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fImemccpy\fR()
function shall return a pointer to the byte after the copy of
.IR c
in
.IR s1 ,
or a null pointer if
.IR c
was not found in the first
.IR n
bytes of
.IR s2 .
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
