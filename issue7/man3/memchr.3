.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fImemchr\fR()
function shall locate the first occurrence of
.IR c
(converted to an
.BR "unsigned char" )
in the initial
.IR n
bytes (each interpreted as
.BR "unsigned char" )
pointed to by
.IR s .
.P
Implementations shall behave as if they read the memory byte by byte
from the beginning of the bytes pointed to by
.IR s
and stop at the first occurrence of
.IR c
(if it is found in the initial
.IR n
bytes).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fImemchr\fR()
function shall return a pointer to the located byte, or a null pointer
if the byte is not found.
