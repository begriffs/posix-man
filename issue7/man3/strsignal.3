.SH NAME
strsignal
\(em get name of signal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <string.h>
.P
char *strsignal(int \fIsignum\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIstrsignal\fR()
function shall map the signal number in
.IR signum
to an implementation-defined string and shall return a pointer to it.
It shall use the same set of messages as the
\fIpsignal\fR()
function.
.P
The application shall not modify the string returned. The returned
pointer might be invalidated or the string content might be overwritten
by a subsequent call to
\fIstrsignal\fR()
or
\fIsetlocale\fR().
.P
The contents of the message strings returned by
\fIstrsignal\fR()
should be determined by the setting of the
.IR LC_MESSAGES
category in the current locale.
.P
The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this
standard calls
\fIstrsignal\fR().
.P
Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application
wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to 0, then call
\fIstrsignal\fR(),
then check
.IR errno .
.P
The
\fIstrsignal\fR()
function need not be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIstrsignal\fR()
shall return a pointer to a string. Otherwise, if
.IR signum
is not a valid signal number, the return value is unspecified.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
If
.IR signum
is not a valid signal number, some implementations return NULL, while
for others the
\fIstrsignal\fR()
function returns a pointer to a string containing an unspecified
message denoting an unknown signal. POSIX.1\(hy2008 leaves this return
value unspecified.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
