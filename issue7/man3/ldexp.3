.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double ldexp(double \fIx\fP, int \fIexp\fP);
float ldexpf(float \fIx\fP, int \fIexp\fP);
long double ldexpl(long double \fIx\fP, int \fIexp\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute the quantity
\fIx\fR\ *\ 2\u\s-3\fIexp\fR\s+3\d.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
.IR x
multiplied by 2, raised to the power
.IR exp .
.P
If these functions would cause overflow, a range error shall occur and
\fIldexp\fR(),
\fIldexpf\fR(),
and
\fIldexpl\fR()
shall return \(+-HUGE_VAL, \(+-HUGE_VALF, and \(+-HUGE_VALL (according
to the sign of
.IR x ),
respectively.
.P
If the correct value would cause underflow,
and is not representable,
a range error may occur, and
\fIldexp\fR(),
\fIldexpf\fR(),
and
\fIldexpl\fR()
shall return
0.0, or
(if IEC 60559 Floating-Point is not supported) an implementation-defined
value no greater in magnitude than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN,
respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0 or \(+-Inf,
.IR x
shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR exp
is 0,
.IR x
shall be returned.
.P
If the correct value would cause underflow, and is representable, a
range error may occur and the correct value shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result overflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.P
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result underflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
