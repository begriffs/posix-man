.SH NAME
killpg
\(em send a signal to a process group
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <signal.h>
.P
int killpg(pid_t \fIpgrp\fP, int \fIsig\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIkillpg\fR()
function shall send the signal specified by
.IR sig
to the process group specified by
.IR pgrp .
.P
If
.IR pgrp
is greater than 1, \fIkillpg\fP(\fIpgrp\fP,\ \fIsig\fR) shall be
equivalent to \fIkill\fP(\(mi\fIpgrp\fP,\ \fIsig\fR). If
.IR pgrp
is less than or equal to 1, the behavior of
\fIkillpg\fR()
is undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Refer to
.IR "\fIkill\fR\^(\|)".
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIkill\fR\^(\|)".
.LP

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Sending a Signal to All Other Members of a Process Group"
.P
The following example shows how the calling process could send a signal
to all other members of its process group. To prevent itself from
receiving the signal it first makes itself immune to the signal by
ignoring it.
