.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fItoupper\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.

or the value of EOF. If the argument has any other value, the behavior
is undefined.
.P
If the argument of
\fItoupper\fR()
or
\fItoupper_l\fR()
represents a lowercase letter, and there exists a corresponding
uppercase letter as defined by character type information in the current
locale
or in the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively (category
.IR LC_CTYPE ),
the result shall be the corresponding uppercase letter.
.P
All other arguments in the domain are returned unchanged.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the
.IR locale
argument to
\fItoupper_l\fR()
is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
object handle.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fItoupper\fR()
and
