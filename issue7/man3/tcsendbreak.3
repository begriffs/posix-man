.SH NAME
tcsendbreak
\(em send a break for a specific duration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>
.P
int tcsendbreak(int \fIfildes\fP, int \fIduration\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the terminal is using asynchronous serial data transmission,
\fItcsendbreak\fR()
shall cause transmission of a continuous stream of zero-valued bits for
a specific duration. If
.IR duration
is 0, it shall cause transmission of zero-valued bits for at least 0.25
seconds, and not more than 0.5 seconds. If
.IR duration
is not 0, it shall send zero-valued bits for an
implementation-defined period of time.
.P
The
.IR fildes
argument is an open file descriptor associated with a terminal.
.P
If the terminal is not using asynchronous serial data transmission, it
is implementation-defined whether
\fItcsendbreak\fR()
sends data to generate a break condition or returns without taking any
action.
.P
Attempts to use
\fItcsendbreak\fR()
from a process which is a member of a background process group on a
.IR fildes
associated with its controlling terminal shall cause the process group
to be sent a SIGTTOU signal.
If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is
ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the
operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, \(mi1 shall
be returned and
.IR errno
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fItcsendbreak\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The
.IR fildes
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.BR EIO
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the calling thread
is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is not ignoring SIGTTOU.
.TP
.BR ENOTTY
The file associated with
.IR fildes
is not a terminal.
