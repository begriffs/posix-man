.SH NAME
sem_getvalue
\(em get the value of a semaphore
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <semaphore.h>
.P
int sem_getvalue(sem_t *restrict \fIsem\fP, int *restrict \fIsval\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIsem_getvalue\fR()
function shall update the location referenced by the
.IR sval
argument to have the value of the semaphore referenced by
.IR sem
without affecting the state of the semaphore. The updated value
represents an actual semaphore value that occurred at some unspecified
time during the call, but it need not be the actual value of the
semaphore when it is returned to the calling process.
.P
If
.IR sem
is locked, then the object to which
.IR sval
points shall either be set to zero or to a negative number whose
absolute value represents the number of processes waiting for the
semaphore at some unspecified time during the call.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIsem_getvalue\fR()
function shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, it shall return
a value of \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIsem_getvalue\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR sem
argument does not refer to a valid semaphore.
