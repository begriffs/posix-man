\(em yield the processor
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
#include <sched.h>
.P
int sched_yield(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIsched_yield\fR()
function shall force the running thread to relinquish the processor
until it again becomes the head of its thread list. It takes no arguments.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIsched_yield\fR()
function shall return 0 if it completes successfully; otherwise, it
shall return a value of \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The conceptual model for scheduling semantics in POSIX.1\(hy2008 defines
a set of thread lists. This set of thread lists is always present
regardless of the scheduling options supported by the system. On a
system where the Process Scheduling option is not supported, portable
applications should not make any assumptions regarding whether threads
from other processes will be on the same thread list.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
