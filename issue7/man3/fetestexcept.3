.SH NAME
fetestexcept
\(em test floating-point exception flags
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <fenv.h>
.P
int fetestexcept(int \fIexcepts\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIfetestexcept\fR()
function shall determine which of a specified subset of the
floating-point exception flags are currently set. The
.IR excepts
argument specifies the floating-point status flags to be queried.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIfetestexcept\fR()
function shall return the value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of the
floating-point exception macros corresponding to the currently set
floating-point exceptions included in
.IR excepts .
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example calls function
\fIf\fR()
if an invalid exception is set, and then function
\fIg\fR()
if an overflow exception is set:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
#include <fenv.h>
/* ... */
{
    #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
    int set_excepts;
    feclearexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_OVERFLOW);
    // maybe raise exceptions
    set_excepts = fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_OVERFLOW);
    if (set_excepts & FE_INVALID) f();
    if (set_excepts & FE_OVERFLOW) g();
    /* ... */
