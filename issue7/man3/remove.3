#include <stdio.h>
.P
int remove(const char *\fIpath\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIremove\fR()
function shall cause the file named by the pathname pointed to by
.IR path
to be no longer accessible by that name. A subsequent attempt to open
that file using that name shall fail, unless it is created anew.
.P
If
.IR path
does not name a directory, \fIremove\fP(\fIpath\fP) shall be equivalent
to \fIunlink\fP(\fIpath\fP).
.P
If
.IR path
names a directory, \fIremove\fP(\fIpath\fP) shall be equivalent to
\fIrmdir\fP(\fIpath\fP).
