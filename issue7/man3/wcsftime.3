.SH NAME
wcsftime
\(em convert date and time to a wide-character string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>
.P
size_t wcsftime(wchar_t *restrict \fIwcs\fP, size_t \fImaxsize\fP,
    const wchar_t *restrict \fIformat\fP, const struct tm *restrict \fItimeptr\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIwcsftime\fR()
function shall be equivalent to the
\fIstrftime\fR()
function, except that:
.IP " *" 4
The argument
.IR wcs
points to the initial element of an array of wide characters into which
the generated output is to be placed.
.IP " *" 4
The argument
.IR maxsize
indicates the maximum number of wide characters to be placed in the
output array.
.IP " *" 4
The argument
.IR format
is a wide-character string and the conversion specifications are
replaced by corresponding sequences of wide characters.
.IP " *" 4
The return value indicates the number of wide characters placed in the
output array.
.P
If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If the total number of resulting wide-character codes including the
terminating null wide-character code is no more than
.IR maxsize ,
\fIwcsftime\fR()
shall return the number of wide-character codes placed into the array
pointed to by
.IR wcs ,
not including the terminating null wide-character code. Otherwise,
zero is returned and the contents of the array are unspecified.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
