.SH SYNOPSIS

#include <wchar.h>
.P

    va_list \fIarg\fP);
int vswscanf(const wchar_t *restrict \fIws\fP, const wchar_t *restrict \fIformat\fP,

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIvfwscanf\fR(),
\fIvswscanf\fR(),
and
\fIvwscanf\fR()
functions shall be equivalent to the
\fIfwscanf\fR(),
\fIswscanf\fR(),
and
\fIwscanf\fR()
functions, respectively, except that instead of being called with a
variable number of arguments, they are called with an argument list as
defined in the
.IR <stdarg.h> 
header. These functions shall not invoke the
.IR va_end
macro. As these functions invoke the
.IR va_arg
macro, the value of
.IR ap
after the return is unspecified.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Refer to
.IR "\fIfwscanf\fR\^(\|)".
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIfwscanf\fR\^(\|)".
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Applications using these functions should call
.IR va_end (\c
.IR ap )
afterwards to clean up.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
