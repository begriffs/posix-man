\(em convert values between host and network byte order
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <arpa/inet.h>
.P
uint32_t htonl(uint32_t \fIhostlong\fP);
uint16_t htons(uint16_t \fIhostshort\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions shall convert 16-bit and 32-bit quantities between
network byte order and host byte order.
.P
On some implementations, these functions are defined as macros.
.P
The
.BR uint32_t
and
.BR uint16_t
types are defined in
.IR <inttypes.h> .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIhtonl\fR()
and
\fIhtons\fR()
functions shall return the argument value converted from host to
network byte order.
.P
The
\fIntohl\fR()
and
\fIntohs\fR()
functions shall return the argument value converted from network to
host byte order.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH "EXAMPLES"
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
These functions are most often used in conjunction with IPv4 addresses
and ports as returned by
\fIgethostent\fR()
and
\fIgetservent\fR().
.SH "RATIONALE"
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
