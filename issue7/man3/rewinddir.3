.SH NAME
rewinddir
\(em reset the position of a directory stream to the beginning
of a directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <dirent.h>
.P
void rewinddir(DIR *\fIdirp\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIrewinddir\fR()
function shall reset the position of the directory stream to which
.IR dirp
refers to the beginning of the directory. It shall also cause the
directory stream to refer to the current state of the corresponding
directory, as a call to
\fIopendir\fR()
would have done. If
.IR dirp
does not refer to a directory stream, the effect is undefined.
.P
After a call to the
\fIfork\fR()
function, either the parent or child (but not both) may continue
processing the directory stream using
\fIreaddir\fR(),
\fIrewinddir\fR(),
or
\fIseekdir\fR().
If both the parent and child processes use these functions, the result
is undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIrewinddir\fR()
function shall not return a value.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIrewinddir\fR()
function should be used in conjunction with
\fIopendir\fR(),
\fIreaddir\fR(),
and
\fIclosedir\fR()
to examine the contents of the directory. This method is recommended
for portability.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
