.SH NAME
clock_getcpuclockid
\(em access a process CPU-time clock
(\fBADVANCED REALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <time.h>
.P
int clock_getcpuclockid(pid_t \fIpid\fP, clockid_t *\fIclock_id\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIclock_getcpuclockid\fR()
function shall return the clock ID of the CPU-time clock of the process
specified by
.IR pid .
If the process described by
.IR pid
exists and the calling process has permission, the clock ID of this
clock shall be returned in
.IR clock_id .
.P
If
.IR pid
is zero, the
\fIclock_getcpuclockid\fR()
function shall return the clock ID of the CPU-time clock of the process
making the call, in
.IR clock_id .
.P
The conditions under which one process has permission to obtain the
CPU-time clock ID of other processes are implementation-defined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIclock_getcpuclockid\fR()
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIclock_getcpuclockid\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EPERM
The requesting process does not have permission to access the CPU-time
clock for the process.
.P
The
\fIclock_getcpuclockid\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR ESRCH
No process can be found corresponding to the process specified by
.IR pid .
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIclock_getcpuclockid\fR()
function is part of the Process CPU-Time Clocks option and need not be
provided on all implementations.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
