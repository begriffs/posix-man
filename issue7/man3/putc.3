.SH NAME
putc
\(em put a byte on a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
.P
int putc(int \fIc\fP, FILE *\fIstream\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIputc\fR()
function shall be equivalent to
\fIfputc\fR(),
except that if it is implemented as a macro it may evaluate
.IR stream
more than once, so the argument should never be an expression with
side-effects.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Refer to
.IR "\fIfputc\fR\^(\|)".
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIfputc\fR\^(\|)".
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Since it may be implemented as a macro,
\fIputc\fR()
may treat a
.IR stream
argument with side-effects incorrectly. In particular,
\fIputc\fP(\fIc\fP,*\fIf\fP++) does not necessarily work correctly.
Therefore, use of this function is not recommended in such situations;
\fIfputc\fR()
should be used instead.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
