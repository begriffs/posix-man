.SH NAME

\(em define character mapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wctype.h>
.P
wctrans_t wctrans(const char *\fIcharclass\fP);
wctrans_t wctrans_l(const char *\fIcharclass\fP, locale_t \fIlocale\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fIwctrans\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIwctrans\fR()
and
\fIwctrans_l\fR()
functions are defined for valid character mapping names identified
in the current locale. The
.IR charclass
is a string identifying a generic character mapping name for which
codeset-specific information is required. The following character
mapping names are defined in all locales:
.BR tolower
and
.BR toupper .
.P
These functions shall return a value of type
.BR wctrans_t ,
which can be used as the second argument to subsequent calls of
\fItowctrans\fR()
and
\fItowctrans_l\fR().
.P
The
\fIwctrans\fR()
and
\fIwctrans_l\fR()
functions shall determine values of
.BR wctrans_t
according to the rules of the coded character set defined by character
mapping information in the current locale
or in the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively (category
.IR LC_CTYPE ).
.P
The values returned by
\fIwctrans\fR()
shall be valid until a call to
\fIsetlocale\fR()
that modifies the category
.IR LC_CTYPE .
.P
The values returned by
\fIwctrans_l\fR()
shall be valid only in calls to
\fItowctrans_l\fR()
with a locale represented by
.IR locale
with the same
.IR LC_CTYPE
category value.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the
.IR locale
argument to
\fIwctrans_l\fR()
is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
object handle.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIwctrans\fR()
and
\fIwctrans_l\fR()
functions shall return 0 and may set
.IR errno
to indicate the error if the given character mapping name is not valid
for the current locale (category
.IR LC_CTYPE );
otherwise, they shall return a non-zero object of type
.BR wctrans_t
that can be used in calls to
\fItowctrans\fR()
and
\fItowctrans_l\fR().
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The character mapping name pointed to by
.IR charclass
is not valid in the current locale.
