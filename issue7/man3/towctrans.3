.SH NAME
towctrans,
towctrans_l
\(em wide-character transliteration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wctype.h>
.P
wint_t towctrans(wint_t \fIwc\fP, wctrans_t \fIdesc\fP);
wint_t towctrans_l(wint_t \fIwc\fP, wctrans_t \fIdesc\fP,
    locale_t \fIlocale\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fItowctrans\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fItowctrans\fR()
and
\fItowctrans_l\fR()
functions shall transliterate the wide-character code
.IR wc
using the mapping described by
.IR desc .
.P
The current setting of the
.IR LC_CTYPE
category in the current locale
or in the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively, should be the same as during the call to
\fIwctrans\fR()
or
\fIwctrans_l\fR()
that returned the value
.IR desc .
.P
If the value of
.IR desc
is invalid (that is, not obtained by a call to
\fIwctrans\fR()
or
.IR desc
is invalidated by a subsequent call to
\fIsetlocale\fR()
that has affected category
.IR LC_CTYPE ),
the result is unspecified.
.P
If the value of
.IR desc
is invalid (that is, not obtained by a call to
\fIwctrans_l\fR()
with the same locale object
.IR locale )
the result is unspecified.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to 0 before calling
\fItowctrans\fR()
or
\fItowctrans_l\fR().
.P
If
.IR errno
is non-zero on return, an error has occurred.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the
.IR locale
argument to
\fItowctrans_l\fR()
is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
object handle.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If successful, the
\fItowctrans\fR()
and
\fItowctrans_l\fR()
functions shall return the mapped value of
.IR wc
using the mapping described by
.IR desc .
Otherwise, they shall return
.IR wc
unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
.IR desc
contains an invalid transliteration descriptor.

None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The strings
.BR \(dqtolower\(dq
