\(em string scanning operation
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
#include <string.h>
.P
char *strrchr(const char *\fIs\fP, int \fIc\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIstrrchr\fR()
function shall locate the last occurrence of
.IR c
(converted to a
.BR char )
in the string pointed to by
.IR s .
The terminating NUL character is considered to be part of the string.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIstrrchr\fR()
shall return a pointer to the byte or a null pointer if
.IR c
does not occur in the string.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Finding the Base Name of a File"
.P
The following example uses
\fIstrrchr\fR()
to get a pointer to the base name of a file. The
\fIstrrchr\fR()
function searches backwards through the name of the file to find the
last
.BR '/' 
character in
.IR name .
This pointer (plus one) will point to the base name of the file.
