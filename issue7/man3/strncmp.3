.P
int strncmp(const char *\fIs1\fP, const char *\fIs2\fP, size_t \fIn\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIstrncmp\fR()
function shall compare not more than
.IR n
bytes (bytes that follow a NUL character are not compared) from the array
pointed to by
.IR s1
to the array pointed to by
.IR s2 .
.P
The sign of a non-zero return value is determined by the sign of the
difference between the values of the first pair of bytes (both
interpreted as type
.BR "unsigned char" )
that differ in the strings being compared.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIstrncmp\fR()
shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the
possibly null-terminated array pointed to by
.IR s1
is greater than, equal to, or less than the possibly null-terminated
array pointed to by
.IR s2
respectively.
