.SH NAME
strcoll,
strcoll_l
\(em string comparison using collating information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <string.h>
.P
int strcoll(const char *\fIs1\fP, const char *\fIs2\fP);
int strcoll_l(const char *\fIs1\fP, const char *\fIs2\fP,
    locale_t \fIlocale\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fIstrcoll\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIstrcoll\fR()
and
\fIstrcoll_l\fR()
functions shall compare the string pointed to by
.IR s1
to the string pointed to by
.IR s2 ,
both interpreted as appropriate to the
.IR LC_COLLATE
category of the current locale,
or of the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively.
.P
The
\fIstrcoll\fR()
and
\fIstrcoll_l\fR()
functions shall not change the setting of
.IR errno
if successful.
.P
Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an
application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to 0, then call
\fIstrcoll\fR(),
or
\fIstrcoll_l\fR()
then check
.IR errno .
.P
The behavior is undefined if the
.IR locale
argument to
\fIstrcoll_l\fR()
is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
object handle.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIstrcoll\fR()
shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than
0, according to whether the string pointed to by
.IR s1
is greater than, equal to, or less than the string pointed to by
.IR s2
when both are interpreted as appropriate to the current locale.
On error,
\fIstrcoll\fR()
may set
.IR errno ,
but no return value is reserved to indicate an error.
.P
Upon successful completion,
\fIstrcoll_l\fR()
shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
according to whether the string pointed to by
.IR s1
is greater than, equal to, or less than the string pointed to by
.IR s2
when both are interpreted as appropriate to the locale represented by
.IR locale .
On error,
\fIstrcoll_l\fR()
may set
.IR errno ,
but no return value is reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR s1
or
.IR s2
arguments contain characters outside the domain of the collating
sequence.
.LP

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Comparing Nodes"
.P
The following example uses an application-defined function,
\fInode_compare\fR(),
to compare two nodes based on an alphabetical ordering of the
.IR string
field.

.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIstrxfrm\fR()
and
\fIstrcmp\fR()
functions should be used for sorting large lists.
