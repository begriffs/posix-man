.SH NAME
exit
\(em terminate a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
void exit(int \fIstatus\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The value of
.IR status
may be 0, EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE,
or any other value, though only the least significant 8 bits (that is,
.IR status
& 0377) shall be available to a waiting parent process.
.P
The
\fIexit\fR()
function shall first call all functions registered by
\fIatexit\fR(),
in the reverse order of their registration, except that a function is
called after any previously registered functions that had already been
called at the time it was registered. Each function is called as many
times as it was registered. If, during the call to any such function, a
call to the
\fIlongjmp\fR()
function is made that would terminate the call to the registered
function, the behavior is undefined.
.P
If a function registered by a call to
\fIatexit\fR()
fails to return, the remaining registered functions shall not be called
and the rest of the
\fIexit\fR()
processing shall not be completed. If
\fIexit\fR()
is called more than once, the behavior is undefined.
.P
The
\fIexit\fR()
function shall then flush all open streams with unwritten buffered data
and close all open streams. Finally, the process shall be terminated
with the same consequences as described in
.IR "Consequences of Process Termination".
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIexit\fR()
function does not return.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP

.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
