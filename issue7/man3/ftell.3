.SH NAME
ftell,
ftello
\(em return a file offset in a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
.P
long ftell(FILE *\fIstream\fP);
off_t ftello(FILE *\fIstream\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIftell\fR()
function shall obtain the current value of the file-position indicator
for the stream pointed to by
.IR stream .
.P
The
\fIftell\fR()
function shall not change the setting of
.IR errno
if successful.
.P
The
\fIftello\fR()
function shall be equivalent to
\fIftell\fR(),
except that the return value is of type
.BR off_t
and the
\fIftello\fR()
function may change the setting of
.IR errno
if successful.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIftell\fR()
and
\fIftello\fR()
shall return the current value of the file-position indicator for the
stream measured in bytes from the beginning of the file.
.P
Otherwise,
\fIftell\fR()
and
\fIftello\fR()
shall return \(mi1, and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIftell\fR()
and
\fIftello\fR()
functions shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The file descriptor underlying
.IR stream
is not an open file descriptor.
.TP
.BR EOVERFLOW
For
\fIftell\fR(),
the current file offset cannot be represented correctly in an object of
type
.BR long .
.TP
.BR EOVERFLOW
For
\fIftello\fR(),
the current file offset cannot be represented correctly in an object of
type
.BR off_t .
.TP
.BR ESPIPE
The file descriptor underlying
.IR stream
is associated with a pipe, FIFO, or socket.
