.SH NAME
isupper,
isupper_l
\(em test for an uppercase letter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <ctype.h>
.P
int isupper(int \fIc\fP);
int isupper_l(int \fIc\fP, locale_t \fIlocale\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fIisupper\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIisupper\fR()
and
\fIisupper_l\fR()
functions shall test whether
.IR c
is a character of class
.BR upper
in the current locale,
or in the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Chapter 7" ", " "Locale".
.P
The
.IR c
argument is an
.BR int ,
the value of which the application shall ensure is a character
representable as an
.BR "unsigned char"
or equal to the value of the macro EOF. If the argument has any other
value, the behavior is undefined.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the
.IR locale
argument to
\fIisupper_l\fR()
is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
object handle.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIisupper\fR()
and
\fIisupper_l\fR()
functions shall return non-zero if
.IR c
is an uppercase letter; otherwise, they shall return 0.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
To ensure applications portability, especially across natural
languages, only these functions and the functions in the reference pages
listed in the SEE ALSO section should be used for character classification.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
