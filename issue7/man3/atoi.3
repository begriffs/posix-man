.SH NAME
atoi
\(em convert a string to an integer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
int atoi(const char *\fIstr\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The call
.IR atoi ( str )
shall be equivalent to:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
(int) strtol(str, (char **)NULL, 10)
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
except that the handling of errors may differ. If the value cannot be
represented, the behavior is undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIatoi\fR()
function shall return the converted value if the value can be
represented.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Converting an Argument"
.P
The following example checks for proper usage of the program. If there
is an argument and the decimal conversion of this argument (obtained
using
\fIatoi\fR())
is greater than 0, then the program has a valid number of minutes to
wait for an event.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
\&...
int minutes_to_event;
\&...
if (argc < 2 || ((minutes_to_event = atoi (argv[1]))) <= 0) {
   fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s minutes\en", argv[0]); exit(1);
}
\&...
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIatoi\fR()
function is subsumed by
\fIstrtol\fR()
but is retained because it is used extensively in existing code. If the
number is not known to be in range,
\fIstrtol\fR()
should be used because
\fIatoi\fR()
is not required to perform any error checking.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
