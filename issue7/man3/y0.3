.SH NAME
y0,
y1,
yn
\(em Bessel functions of the second kind
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double y0(double \fIx\fP);
double y1(double \fIx\fP);
double yn(int \fIn\fP, double \fIx\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIy0\fR(),
\fIy1\fR(),
and
\fIyn\fR()
functions shall compute Bessel functions of
.IR x
of the second kind of orders 0, 1, and
.IR n ,
respectively.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the relevant
Bessel value of
.IR x
of the second kind.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, NaN shall be returned.
.P
If the
.IR x
argument to these functions is negative, \(miHUGE_VAL or NaN shall be
returned, and a domain error may occur.
.P
If
.IR x
is 0.0, \(miHUGE_VAL shall be returned and a pole error may occur.
.P
If the correct result would cause underflow, 0.0 shall be returned and
a range error may occur.
.P
If the correct result would cause overflow, \(miHUGE_VAL or 0.0 shall
be returned and a range error may occur.
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Domain\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is negative.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EDOM] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.IP "Pole\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is zero.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the divide-by-zero floating-point exception shall be
raised.
.RE
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The correct result would cause overflow.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is too large in magnitude, or the correct result would cause
underflow.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
