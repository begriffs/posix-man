.SH NAME
mbstowcs
\(em convert a character string to a wide-character string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
size_t mbstowcs(wchar_t *restrict \fIpwcs\fP, const char *restrict \fIs\fP,
    size_t \fIn\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fImbstowcs\fR()
function shall convert a sequence of characters that begins in the
initial shift state from the array pointed to by
.IR s
into a sequence of corresponding wide-character codes and shall store
not more than
.IR n
wide-character codes into the array pointed to by
.IR pwcs .
No characters that follow a null byte (which is converted into a
wide-character code with value 0) shall be examined or converted. Each
character shall be converted as if by a call to
\fImbtowc\fR(),
except that the shift state of
\fImbtowc\fR()
is not affected.
.P
No more than
.IR n
elements shall be modified in the array pointed to by
.IR pwcs .
If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
undefined.
.P
The behavior of this function shall be affected by the
.IR LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale.
If
.IR pwcs
is a null pointer,
\fImbstowcs\fR()
shall return the length required to convert the entire array regardless
of the value of
.IR n ,
but no values are stored.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If an invalid character is encountered,
\fImbstowcs\fR()
shall return (\fBsize_t\fP)\(mi1
and shall set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.P
Otherwise,
\fImbstowcs\fR()
shall return the number of the array elements modified
(or required if
.IR pwcs
is null),
not including a terminating 0 code, if any. The array shall
not be zero-terminated if the value returned is
.IR n .
.SH ERRORS
The
\fImbstowcs\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EILSEQ
An invalid byte sequence is detected.
