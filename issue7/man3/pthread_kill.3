.SH NAME
pthread_kill
\(em send a signal to a thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <signal.h>
.P
int pthread_kill(pthread_t \fIthread\fP, int \fIsig\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIpthread_kill\fR()
function shall request that a signal be delivered to the specified
thread.
.P
As in
\fIkill\fR(),
if
.IR sig
is zero, error checking shall be performed but no signal shall
actually be sent.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the function shall return a value of zero.
Otherwise, the function shall return an error number. If the
\fIpthread_kill\fR()
function fails, no signal shall be sent.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIpthread_kill\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of the
.IR sig
argument is an invalid or unsupported signal number.
.P
The
\fIpthread_kill\fR()
function shall not return an error code of
.BR [EINTR] .
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIpthread_kill\fR()
function provides a mechanism for asynchronously directing a signal at
a thread in the calling process. This could be used, for example, by
one thread to affect broadcast delivery of a signal to a set of
threads.
.P
Note that
\fIpthread_kill\fR()
only causes the signal to be handled in the context of the given
thread; the signal action (termination or stopping) affects the
process as a whole.
.SH RATIONALE
If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of its
lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
.BR [ESRCH] 
error.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
