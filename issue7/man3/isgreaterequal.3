.SH NAME
isgreaterequal
\(em test if x is greater than or equal to y
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
int isgreaterequal(real-floating \fIx\fP, real-floating \fIy\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIisgreaterequal\fR()
macro shall determine whether its first argument is greater than or
equal to its second argument. The value of
.IR isgreaterequal (\c
.IR x ,
.IR y )
shall be equal to (\fIx\fR)\ \(>=\ (\fIy\fR); however, unlike
(\fIx\fR)\ \(>=\ (\fIy\fR),
.IR isgreaterequal (\c
.IR x ,
.IR y )
shall not raise the invalid floating-point exception when
.IR x
and
.IR y
are unordered.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIisgreaterequal\fR()
macro shall return the value of (\fIx\fR)\ \(>=\ (\fIy\fR).
.P
If
.IR x
or
.IR y
is NaN, 0 shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP

.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The relational and equality operators support the usual mathematical
relationships between numeric values. For any ordered pair of numeric
values, exactly one of the relationships (less, greater, and equal) is
true. Relational operators may raise the invalid floating-point
exception when argument values are NaNs. For a NaN and a numeric value,
or for two NaNs, just the unordered relationship is true. This macro
is a quiet (non-floating-point exception raising) version of a
relational operator. It facilitates writing efficient code that
accounts for NaNs without suffering the invalid floating-point
exception. In the SYNOPSIS section,
.BR real-floating
indicates that the argument shall be an expression of
.BR real-floating
type.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
