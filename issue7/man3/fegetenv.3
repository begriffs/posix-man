.SH NAME
fegetenv,
fesetenv
\(em get and set current floating-point environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <fenv.h>
.P
int fegetenv(fenv_t *\fIenvp\fP);
int fesetenv(const fenv_t *\fIenvp\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIfegetenv\fR()
function shall attempt to store the current floating-point environment
in the object pointed to by
.IR envp .
.P
The
\fIfesetenv\fR()
function shall attempt to establish the floating-point environment
represented by the object pointed to by
.IR envp .
The argument
.IR envp
shall point to an object set by a call to
\fIfegetenv\fR()
or
\fIfeholdexcept\fR(),
or equal a floating-point environment macro. The
\fIfesetenv\fR()
function does not raise floating-point exceptions, but only installs
the state of the floating-point status flags represented through its
argument.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If the representation was successfully stored,
\fIfegetenv\fR()
shall return zero. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value.
If the environment was successfully established,
\fIfesetenv\fR()
shall return zero. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value.
