.SH NAME
free
\(em free allocated memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
void free(void *\fIptr\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIfree\fR()
function shall cause the space pointed to by
.IR ptr
to be deallocated; that is, made available for further allocation. If
.IR ptr
is a null pointer, no action shall occur. Otherwise, if the argument
does not match a pointer earlier returned by a function in POSIX.1\(hy2008 that
allocates memory as if by
\fImalloc\fR(),
or if the space has been deallocated by a call to
\fIfree\fR()
or
\fIrealloc\fR(),
the behavior is undefined.
.P
Any use of a pointer that refers to freed space results in undefined
behavior.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIfree\fR()
function shall not return a value.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
There is now no requirement for the implementation to support the
inclusion of
.IR <malloc.h> .
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
