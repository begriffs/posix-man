.SH NAME
posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy,
posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy
\(em get and set the spawn-schedpolicy attribute of a spawn attributes object
(\fBADVANCED REALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>
#include <sched.h>
.P
int posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy(const posix_spawnattr_t
    *restrict \fIattr\fP, int *restrict \fIschedpolicy\fP);
int posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy(posix_spawnattr_t *\fIattr\fP,
    int \fIschedpolicy\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIposix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy\fR()
function shall obtain the value of the
.IR spawn-schedpolicy
attribute from the attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
.P
The
\fIposix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy\fR()
function shall set the
.IR spawn-schedpolicy
attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
.P
The
.IR spawn-schedpolicy
attribute represents the scheduling policy to be assigned to the new
process image in a spawn operation (if POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is set
in the
.IR spawn-flags
attribute). The default value of this attribute is unspecified.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIposix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy\fR()
shall return zero and store the value of the
.IR spawn-schedpolicy
attribute of
.IR attr
into the object referenced by the
.IR schedpolicy
parameter; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.
.P
Upon successful completion,
\fIposix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy\fR()
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value specified by
.IR attr
is invalid.
.P
The
\fIposix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of the attribute being set is not valid.
.LP

.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
These functions are part of the Spawn and Process Scheduling options
and need not be provided on all implementations.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
