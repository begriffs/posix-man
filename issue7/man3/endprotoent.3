.P
void endprotoent(void);
struct protoent *getprotobyname(const char *\fIname\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions shall retrieve information about protocols. This
information is considered to be stored in a database that can be
accessed sequentially or randomly. The implementation of this database
is unspecified.
.P
The
\fIsetprotoent\fR()
function shall open a connection to the database, and set the next
entry to the first entry. If the
.IR stayopen
argument is non-zero, the connection to the network protocol database
shall not be closed after each call to
\fIgetprotoent\fR()
(either directly, or indirectly through one of the other
.IR getproto* (\|)
functions), and the implementation may maintain an open file descriptor
for the database.
.P
The
\fIgetprotobyname\fR()
function shall search the database from the beginning and find the
first entry for which the protocol name specified by
.IR name
matches the
.IR p_name
member, opening and closing a connection to the database as necessary.
.P
The
\fIgetprotobynumber\fR()
function shall search the database from the beginning and find the
first entry for which the protocol number specified by
.IR proto
matches the
.IR p_proto
member, opening and closing a connection to the database as necessary.
.P
The
\fIgetprotoent\fR()
function shall read the next entry of the database, opening and closing
a connection to the database as necessary.
.P
The
\fIgetprotobyname\fR(),
\fIgetprotobynumber\fR(),
and
\fIgetprotoent\fR()
functions shall each return a pointer to a
.BR protoent
structure, the members of which shall contain the fields of an entry in
the network protocol database.
.P
The
\fIendprotoent\fR()
function shall close the connection to the database, releasing any
open file descriptor.
.P
These functions need not be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIgetprotobyname\fR(),
\fIgetprotobynumber\fR(),
and
\fIgetprotoent\fR()
return a pointer to a
.BR protoent
structure if the requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the
end of the database was reached or the requested entry was not found.
Otherwise, a null pointer is returned.
.P
The application shall not modify the structure to which the return
value points, nor any storage areas pointed to by pointers within the
structure. The returned pointer, and pointers within the structure,
might be invalidated or the structure or the storage areas might be
overwritten by a subsequent call to
\fIgetprotobyname\fR(),
\fIgetprotobynumber\fR(),
or
\fIgetprotoent\fR().
