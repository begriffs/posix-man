.SH NAME
ungetwc
\(em push wide-character code back into the input stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
.P
wint_t ungetwc(wint_t \fIwc\fP, FILE *\fIstream\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIungetwc\fR()
function shall push the character corresponding to the wide-character
code specified by
.IR wc
back onto the input stream pointed to by
.IR stream .
The pushed-back characters shall be returned by subsequent reads on that
stream in the reverse order of their pushing. A successful intervening
call (with the stream pointed to by
.IR stream )
to a file-positioning function (\c
\fIfseek\fR(),
\c
\fIfseeko\fR(),
\fIfsetpos\fR(),
or
\fIrewind\fR())
or
\fIfflush\fR()
shall discard any pushed-back characters for the stream. The external
storage corresponding to the stream is unchanged.
.P
At least one character of push-back shall be provided. If
\fIungetwc\fR()
is called too many times on the same stream without an intervening read
or file-positioning operation on that stream, the operation may fail.
.P
If the value of
.IR wc
equals that of the macro WEOF, the operation shall fail and the input
stream shall be left unchanged.
.P
A successful call to
\fIungetwc\fR()
shall clear the end-of-file indicator for the stream. The value of the
file-position indicator for the stream after all pushed-back characters
have been read, or discarded by calling
\fIfseek\fR(),
\c
\fIfseeko\fR(),
\fIfsetpos\fR(),
or
\fIrewind\fR()
(but not
\fIfflush\fR()),
shall be the same as it was before the characters were pushed back. The
file-position indicator is decremented (by one or more) by each successful
call to
\fIungetwc\fR();
if its value was 0 before a call, its value is unspecified after the call.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIungetwc\fR()
shall return the wide-character code corresponding to the pushed-back
character. Otherwise, it shall return WEOF.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIungetwc\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EILSEQ
An invalid character sequence is detected, or a wide-character code
does not correspond to a valid character.
