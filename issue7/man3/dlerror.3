.SH NAME
dlerror
\(em get diagnostic information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <dlfcn.h>
.P
char *dlerror(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIdlerror\fR()
function shall return a null-terminated character string (with no
trailing
<newline>)
that describes the last error that occurred during dynamic linking
processing. If no dynamic linking errors have occurred since the last
invocation of
\fIdlerror\fR(),
\fIdlerror\fR()
shall return NULL.
Thus, invoking
\fIdlerror\fR()
a second time, immediately following a prior invocation, shall result
in NULL being returned.
.P
It is implementation-defined whether or not the
\fIdlerror\fR()
function is thread-safe. A thread-safe implementation shall return only
errors that occur on the current thread.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If successful,
\fIdlerror\fR()
shall return a null-terminated character string; otherwise, NULL
shall be returned.
.P
The application shall not modify the string returned. The returned
pointer might be invalidated or the string content might be overwritten
by a subsequent call to
\fIdlerror\fR()
in the same thread (if
\fIdlerror\fR()
is thread-safe) or in any thread (if
\fIdlerror\fR()
is not thread-safe).
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example prints out the last dynamic linking error:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
\&...
#include <dlfcn.h>
.P
char *errstr;
.P
errstr = dlerror();
if (errstr != NULL)
    printf ("A dynamic linking error occurred: (%s)\en", errstr);
\&...
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Depending on the application environment with respect to asynchronous
execution events, such as signals or other asynchronous computation
sharing the address space, conforming applications should use a critical
section to retrieve the error pointer and buffer.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
