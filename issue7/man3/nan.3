.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The function call \fInan\fR("\fIn-char-sequence\fR") shall be
equivalent to:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
strtod("NAN(\fIn-char-sequence\fP)", (char **) NULL);
.fi \fR

The function call \fInan\fR("\|") shall be equivalent to:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
strtod("NAN()", (char **) NULL)
.fi \fR

.P
If
.IR tagp
does not point to an
.IR n -\c
.BR char
sequence or an empty string, the function call shall be equivalent to:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
strtod("NAN", (char **) NULL)
.fi \fR

.RE
.P
Function calls to
\fInanf\fR()
and
\fInanl\fR()
are equivalent to the corresponding function calls to
\fIstrtof\fR()
and
\fIstrtold\fR().
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
These functions shall return a quiet NaN, if available, with content
indicated through
.IR tagp .
.P
If the implementation does not support quiet NaNs, these functions
shall return zero.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
