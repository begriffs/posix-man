.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>
.P
pid_t getpgid(pid_t \fIpid\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIgetpgid\fR()
function shall return the process group ID of the process whose process
ID is equal to
.IR pid .
If
.IR pid
is equal to 0,
\fIgetpgid\fR()
shall return the process group ID of the calling process.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIgetpgid\fR()
shall return a process group ID. Otherwise, it shall return
(\fBpid_t\fP)\(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIgetpgid\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EPERM
The process whose process ID is equal to
.IR pid
is not in the same session as the calling process, and the
implementation does not allow access to the process group ID of that
process from the calling process.
.TP
.BR ESRCH
There is no process with a process ID equal to
.IR pid .
.P
The
\fIgetpgid\fR()
function may fail if:
