.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>
.P
pid_t getsid(pid_t \fIpid\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIgetsid\fR()
function shall obtain the process group ID of the process that is the
session leader of the process specified by
.IR pid .
If
.IR pid
is (\fBpid_t\fR)0, it specifies the calling process.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIgetsid\fR()
shall return the process group ID of the session leader of the specified
process. Otherwise, it shall return \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIgetsid\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EPERM
The process specified by
.IR pid
is not in the same session as the calling process, and the
implementation does not allow access to the process group ID of the
session leader of that process from the calling process.
.TP
.BR ESRCH
There is no process with a process ID equal to
.IR pid .
