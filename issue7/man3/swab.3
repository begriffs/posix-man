.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIswab\fR()
function shall copy
.IR nbytes
bytes, which are pointed to by
.IR src ,
to the object pointed to by
.IR dest ,
exchanging adjacent bytes. The
.IR nbytes
argument should be even. If
.IR nbytes
is odd,
\fIswab\fR()
copies and exchanges
.IR nbytes \(mi1
bytes and the disposition of the last byte is unspecified. If copying
takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
If
.IR nbytes
is negative,
\fIswab\fR()
does nothing.
