.SH NAME
setpgrp
\(em set the process group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>
.P
pid_t setpgrp(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If the calling process is not already a session leader,
\fIsetpgrp\fR()
sets the process group ID of the calling process to the process ID of
the calling process. If
\fIsetpgrp\fR()
creates a new session, then the new session has no controlling
terminal.
.P
The
\fIsetpgrp\fR()
function has no effect when the calling process is a session leader.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon completion,
\fIsetpgrp\fR()
shall return the process group ID.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
It is unspecified whether this function behaves as
.IR setpgid (0,0)
or
\fIsetsid\fR()
unless the process is already a session leader. Therefore, applications
are encouraged to use
\fIsetpgid\fR()
or
\fIsetsid\fR()
as appropriate.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
The
\fIsetpgrp\fR()
function may be removed in a future version.
