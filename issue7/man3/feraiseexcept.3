.SH NAME
feraiseexcept
\(em raise floating-point exception
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <fenv.h>
.P
int feraiseexcept(int \fIexcepts\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIferaiseexcept\fR()
function shall attempt to raise the supported floating-point exceptions
represented by the argument
.IR excepts .
The order in which these floating-point exceptions are raised is
unspecified. Whether the
\fIferaiseexcept\fR()
function additionally raises the inexact floating-point exception
whenever it raises the overflow or underflow floating-point exception
is implementation-defined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If the argument is zero or if all the specified exceptions were
successfully raised,
\fIferaiseexcept\fR()
shall return zero. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The effect is intended to be similar to that of floating-point
exceptions raised by arithmetic operations. Hence, enabled traps for
floating-point exceptions raised by this function are taken.
.SH RATIONALE
Raising overflow or underflow is allowed to also raise inexact because
on some architectures the only practical way to raise an exception is
to execute an instruction that has the exception as a side-effect. The
function is not restricted to accept only valid coincident expressions
for atomic operations, so the function can be used to raise exceptions
accrued over several operations.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
