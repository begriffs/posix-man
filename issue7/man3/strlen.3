.SH NAME
strlen, strnlen
\(em get length of fixed size string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <string.h>
.P
size_t strlen(const char *\fIs\fP);
size_t strnlen(const char *\fIs\fP, size_t \fImaxlen\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fIstrlen\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIstrlen\fR()
function shall compute the number of bytes in the string to which
.IR s
points, not including the terminating NUL character.
.P
The
\fIstrnlen\fR()
function shall compute the smaller of the number of bytes in the array
to which
.IR s
points, not including the terminating NUL character, or the value of the
.IR maxlen
argument. The
\fIstrnlen\fR()
function shall never examine more than
.IR maxlen
bytes of the array pointed to by
.IR s .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIstrlen\fR()
function shall return the length of
.IR s ;
no return value shall be reserved to indicate an error.
.P
The
\fIstrnlen\fR()
function shall return an integer containing the smaller of either the
length of the string pointed to by
.IR s
or
.IR maxlen .
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Getting String Lengths"
.P
The following example sets the maximum length of
.IR key
and
.IR data
by using
\fIstrlen\fR()
to get the lengths of those strings.
