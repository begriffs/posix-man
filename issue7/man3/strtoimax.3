.SH NAME
strtoimax,
strtoumax
\(em convert string to integer type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <inttypes.h>
.P
intmax_t strtoimax(const char *restrict \fInptr\fP, char **restrict \fIendptr\fP,
    int \fIbase\fP);
uintmax_t strtoumax(const char *restrict \fInptr\fP, char **restrict \fIendptr\fP,
    int \fIbase\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall be equivalent to the
\fIstrtol\fR(),
\fIstrtoll\fR(),
\fIstrtoul\fR(),
and
\fIstrtoull\fR()
functions, except that the initial portion of the string shall be
converted to
.BR intmax_t
and
.BR uintmax_t
representation, respectively.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
These functions shall return the converted value, if any.
.P
If no conversion could be performed, zero shall be returned
and
.IR errno
may be set to
.BR [EINVAL] .
.P
If the value of
.IR base
is not supported, 0 shall be returned and
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EINVAL] .
.P
If the correct value is outside the range of representable values,
{INTMAX_MAX},
{INTMAX_MIN},
or
{UINTMAX_MAX}
shall be returned (according to the return type and sign of the value,
if any), and
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of
.IR base
is not supported.
.TP
.BR ERANGE
The value to be returned is not representable.
.P
These functions may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
No conversion could be performed.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Since the value of
.IR *endptr
is unspecified if the value of
.IR base
is not supported, applications should either ensure that
.IR base
has a supported value (0 or between 2 and 36) before the call, or check
for an
.BR [EINVAL] 
error before examining
.IR *endptr .
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
