.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIwcsncat\fR()
function shall append not more than
.IR n
wide-character codes (a null wide-character code and wide-character
codes that follow it are not appended) from the array pointed to by
.IR ws2
to the end of the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws1 .
The initial wide-character code of
.IR ws2
shall overwrite the null wide-character code at the end of
.IR ws1 .
A terminating null wide-character code shall always be appended to the
result. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
behavior is undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIwcsncat\fR()
function shall return
.IR ws1 ;
no return value is reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
