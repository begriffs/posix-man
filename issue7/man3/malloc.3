.SH NAME
malloc
\(em a memory allocator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
void *malloc(size_t \fIsize\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fImalloc\fR()
function shall allocate unused space for an object whose size in
bytes is specified by
.IR size
and whose value is unspecified.
.P
The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls to
\fImalloc\fR()
is unspecified. The pointer returned if the allocation succeeds shall
be suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type
of object and then used to access such an object in the space allocated
(until the space is explicitly freed or reallocated). Each such
allocation shall yield a pointer to an object disjoint from any other
object. The pointer returned points to the start (lowest byte address)
of the allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a null
pointer shall be returned. If the size of the space requested is 0, the
behavior is implementation-defined: the value returned shall be either
a null pointer or a unique pointer.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion with
.IR size
not equal to 0,
\fImalloc\fR()
shall return a pointer to the allocated space. If
.IR size
is 0, either a null pointer or a unique pointer that can be
successfully passed to
\fIfree\fR()
shall be returned. Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer
and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fImalloc\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
Insufficient storage space is available.
