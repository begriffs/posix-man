.SH NAME
setkey
\(em set encoding key
(\fBCRYPT\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
void setkey(const char *\fIkey\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIsetkey\fR()
function provides access to an implementation-defined encoding
algorithm. The argument of
\fIsetkey\fR()
is an array of length 64 bytes containing only the bytes with numerical
value of 0 and 1. If this string is divided into groups of 8, the
low-order bit in each group is ignored; this gives a 56-bit key which
is used by the algorithm. This is the key that shall be used with the
algorithm to encode a string
.IR block
passed to
\fIencrypt\fR().
.P
The
\fIsetkey\fR()
function shall not change the setting of
.IR errno
if successful. An application wishing to check for error situations
should set
.IR errno
to 0 before calling
\fIsetkey\fR().
If
.IR errno
is non-zero on return, an error has occurred.
.P
The
\fIsetkey\fR()
function need not be thread-safe.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
No values are returned.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIsetkey\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR ENOSYS
The functionality is not supported on this implementation.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Decoding need not be implemented in all environments. This is related
to government restrictions in some countries on encryption and
decryption routines. Historical practice has been to ship a different
version of the encryption library without the decryption feature in the
routines supplied. Thus the exported version of
\fIencrypt\fR()
does encoding but not decoding.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
