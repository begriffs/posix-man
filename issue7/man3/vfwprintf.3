vwprintf
\(em wide-character formatted output of a stdarg argument list
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
.P
int vfwprintf(FILE *restrict \fIstream\fP, const wchar_t *restrict \fIformat\fP,
    va_list \fIarg\fP);
int vswprintf(wchar_t *restrict \fIws\fP, size_t \fIn\fP,

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIvfwprintf\fR(),
\fIvswprintf\fR(),
and
\fIvwprintf\fR()
functions shall be equivalent to
\fIfwprintf\fR(),
\fIswprintf\fR(),
and
\fIwprintf\fR()
respectively, except that instead of being called with a variable
number of arguments, they are called with an argument list as defined
by
.IR <stdarg.h> .
.P
These functions shall not invoke the
.IR va_end
macro. However, as these functions do invoke the
.IR va_arg
macro, the value of
.IR ap
after the return is unspecified.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Refer to
.IR "\fIfwprintf\fR\^(\|)".
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIfwprintf\fR\^(\|)".
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Applications using these functions should call \fIva_end\fP(\fIap\fP)
afterwards to clean up.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
