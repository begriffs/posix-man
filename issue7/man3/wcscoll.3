.SH NAME
wcscoll,
wcscoll_l
\(em wide-character string comparison using collating information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>
.P
int wcscoll(const wchar_t *\fIws1\fP, const wchar_t *\fIws2\fP);
int wcscoll_l(const wchar_t *\fIws1\fP, const wchar_t *\fIws2\fP,
    locale_t \fIlocale\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fIwcscoll\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIwcscoll\fR()
and
\fIwcscoll_l\fR()
functions shall compare the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws1
to the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws2 ,
both interpreted as appropriate to the
.IR LC_COLLATE
category of the current locale,
or the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively.
.P
The
\fIwcscoll\fR()
and
\fIwcscoll_l\fR()
functions shall not change the setting of
.IR errno
if successful.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to 0 before calling
\fIwcscoll\fR()
or
\fIwcscoll_l\fR().
If
.IR errno
is non-zero on return, an error has occurred.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the
.IR locale
argument to
\fIwcscoll_l\fR()
is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
object handle.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIwcscoll\fR()
and
\fIwcscoll_l\fR()
shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
according to whether the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws1
is greater than, equal to, or less than the wide-character string
pointed to by
.IR ws2 ,
when both are interpreted as appropriate to the current locale,
or to the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively. On error,
\fIwcscoll\fR()
and
\fIwcscoll_l\fR()
shall set
.IR errno ,
but no return value is reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR ws1
or
.IR ws2
arguments contain wide-character codes outside the domain of the
collating sequence.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIwcsxfrm\fR()
and
\fIwcscmp\fR()
functions should be used for sorting large lists.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
