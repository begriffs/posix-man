.SH NAME
cfsetospeed
\(em set output baud rate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>
.P
int cfsetospeed(struct termios *\fItermios_p\fP, speed_t \fIspeed\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIcfsetospeed\fR()
function shall set the output baud rate stored in the structure pointed
to by
.IR termios_p
to
.IR speed .
.P
There shall be no effect on the baud rates set in the hardware until a
subsequent successful call to
\fItcsetattr\fR()
with the same
.BR termios
structure. Similarly, errors resulting from attempts to set baud rates
not supported by the terminal device need not be detected until the
\fItcsetattr\fR()
function is called.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIcfsetospeed\fR()
shall return 0; otherwise, it shall return \(mi1 and
.IR errno
may be set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIcfsetospeed\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR speed
value is not a valid baud rate.
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of
.IR speed
is outside the range of possible speed values as specified in
.IR <termios.h> .
