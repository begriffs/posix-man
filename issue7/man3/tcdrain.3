.SH NAME
tcdrain
\(em wait for transmission of output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <termios.h>
.P
int tcdrain(int \fIfildes\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fItcdrain\fR()
function shall block until all output written to the object referred
to by
.IR fildes
is transmitted. The
.IR fildes
argument is an open file descriptor associated with a terminal.
.P
Any attempts to use
\fItcdrain\fR()
from a process which is a member of a background process group on a
.IR fildes
associated with its controlling terminal, shall cause the process group
to be sent a SIGTTOU signal.
If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is
ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the
operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, \(mi1
shall be returned and
.IR errno
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fItcdrain\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The
.IR fildes
argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.BR EINTR
A signal interrupted
\fItcdrain\fR().
.TP
.BR EIO
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the calling thread
is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is not ignoring SIGTTOU.
.TP
.BR ENOTTY
The file associated with
.IR fildes
is not a terminal.
