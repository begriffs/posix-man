.SH NAME
setbuf
\(em assign buffering to a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
.P
void setbuf(FILE *restrict \fIstream\fP, char *restrict \fIbuf\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
Except that it returns no value, the function call:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
setbuf(stream, buf)
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
shall be equivalent to:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
setvbuf(stream, buf, _IOFBF, BUFSIZ)
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
if
.IR buf
is not a null pointer, or to:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
setvbuf(stream, buf, _IONBF, BUFSIZ)
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
if
.IR buf
is a null pointer.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIsetbuf\fR()
function shall not return a value.
.SH ERRORS
Although the
\fIsetvbuf\fR()
interface may set
.IR errno
in defined ways, the value of
.IR errno
after a call to
\fIsetbuf\fR()
is unspecified.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
A common source of error is allocating buffer space as an ``automatic''
variable in a code block, and then failing to close the stream in the
same block.
.P
With
\fIsetbuf\fR(),
allocating a buffer of BUFSIZ bytes does not necessarily imply that all
of BUFSIZ bytes are used for the buffer area.
.P
Since
.IR errno
is not required to be unchanged on success, in order to correctly detect
and possibly recover from errors, applications should use
\fIsetvbuf\fR()
instead of
\fIsetbuf\fR().
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
