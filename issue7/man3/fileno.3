.SH NAME
fileno
\(em map a stream pointer to a file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
.P
int fileno(FILE *\fIstream\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIfileno\fR()
function shall return the integer file descriptor associated with
the stream pointed to by
.IR stream .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIfileno\fR()
shall return the integer value of the file descriptor associated with
.IR stream .
Otherwise, the value \(mi1 shall be returned and
.IR errno
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIfileno\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The
.IR stream
argument is not a valid stream, or the stream is not associated
with a file.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
Without some specification of which file descriptors are associated
with these streams, it is impossible for an application to set up the
streams for another application it starts with
\fIfork\fR()
and
.IR exec .
In particular, it would not be possible to write a portable version of
the
.IR sh
command interpreter (although there may be other constraints that would
prevent that portability).
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
