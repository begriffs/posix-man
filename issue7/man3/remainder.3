.SH NAME

\(em remainder function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double remainder(double \fIx\fP, double \fIy\fP);
float remainderf(float \fIx\fP, float \fIy\fP);
long double remainderl(long double \fIx\fP, long double \fIy\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall return the floating-point remainder
.IR r =\c
.IR x \(mi\c
.IR ny
when
.IR y
is non-zero. The value
.IR n
is the integral value nearest the exact value
.IR x /\c
.IR y .
When |\|\fIn\fR\(mi\fIx\fR/\fIy\fR\||=\(12, the value
.IR n
is chosen to be even.
.P
The behavior of
\fIremainder\fR()
shall be independent of the rounding mode.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the
floating-point remainder
.IR r =\c
.IR x \(mi\c
.IR ny
when
.IR y
is non-zero.
.P
On systems that do not support the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, if
.IR y
is zero, it is implementation-defined whether a domain error occurs or
zero is returned.
.P
If
.IR x
or
.IR y
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is infinite or
.IR y
is 0 and the other is non-NaN, a domain error shall occur, and a NaN
shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Domain\ Error" 12
The
.IR x
argument is \(+-Inf, or the
.IR y
argument is \(+-0 and the other argument is non-NaN.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EDOM] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.P
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Domain\ Error" 12
The
.IR y
argument is zero.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EDOM] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
