.SH NAME
pthread_rwlockattr_destroy,
pthread_rwlockattr_init
\(em destroy and initialize the read-write lock attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <pthread.h>
.P
int pthread_rwlockattr_destroy(pthread_rwlockattr_t *\fIattr\fP);
int pthread_rwlockattr_init(pthread_rwlockattr_t *\fIattr\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_destroy\fR()
function shall destroy a read-write lock attributes object. A destroyed
.IR attr
attributes object can be reinitialized using
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_init\fR();
the results of otherwise referencing the object after it
has been destroyed are undefined. An implementation may cause
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_destroy\fR()
to set the object referenced by
.IR attr
to an invalid value.
.P
The
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_init\fR()
function shall initialize a read-write lock attributes object
.IR attr
with the default value for all of the attributes defined by the
implementation.
.P
Results are undefined if
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_init\fR()
is called specifying an already initialized
.IR attr
attributes object.
.P
After a read-write lock attributes object has been used to initialize
one or more read-write locks, any function affecting the attributes
object (including destruction) shall not affect any previously
initialized read-write locks.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_destroy\fR()
does not refer to an initialized read-write lock attributes object.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If successful, the
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_destroy\fR()
and
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_init\fR()
functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_init\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the read-write lock attributes
object.
.P
These functions shall not return an error code of
.BR [EINTR] .
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_destroy\fR()
does not refer to an initialized read-write lock attributes object,
it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
.BR [EINVAL] 
error.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
