.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIsem_destroy\fR()
function shall destroy the unnamed semaphore indicated by
.IR sem .
Only a semaphore that was created using
\fIsem_init\fR()
may be destroyed using
\fIsem_destroy\fR();
the effect of calling
\fIsem_destroy\fR()
with a named semaphore is undefined. The effect of subsequent use of
the semaphore
.IR sem
is undefined until
.IR sem
is reinitialized by another call to
\fIsem_init\fR().
.P
It is safe to destroy an initialized semaphore upon which no threads
are currently blocked. The effect of destroying a semaphore upon which
other threads are currently blocked is undefined.

Upon successful completion, a value of zero shall be returned. Otherwise,
a value of \(mi1 shall be returned and
.IR errno
set to indicate the error.
