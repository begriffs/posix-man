.SH NAME
trunc,
truncf,
truncl
\(em round to truncated integer value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double trunc(double \fIx\fP);
float truncf(float \fIx\fP);
long double truncl(long double \fIx\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall round their argument to the integer value, in
floating format, nearest to but no larger in magnitude than the
argument.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the truncated
integer value.
.br \" without this, margin code is on the line above
The result shall have the same sign as
.IR x .
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0 or \(+-Inf,
.IR x
shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The integral value returned by these functions need not be expressible
as an
.BR intmax_t .
The return value should be tested before assigning it to an integer type
to avoid the undefined results of an integer overflow.
.P
These functions may raise the inexact floating-point exception if the
result differs in value from the argument.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
