.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fIwctype\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIwctype\fR()
and
\fIwctype_l\fR()
functions are defined for valid character class names as defined
in the current locale
or in the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively.
.P
The
.IR property
argument is a string identifying a generic character class for which
codeset-specific type information is required. The following character
class names shall be defined in all locales:
.sp
.RS
.TS
tab(!);
lB lB lB.
T{
.nf
alnum
alpha
blank
cntrl
T}!T{
.nf
digit
graph
lower
print
T}!T{
.nf
punct
space
upper
xdigit
.fi
T}
.TE
.RE
.P
Additional character class names defined in the locale definition file
(category
.IR LC_CTYPE )
can also be specified.
.P
These functions shall return a value of type
.BR wctype_t ,
which can be used as the second argument to subsequent calls of
\fIiswctype\fR()
and
\fIiswctype_l\fR().
.P
The
\fIwctype\fR()
and
\fIwctype_l\fR()
functions shall determine values of
.BR wctype_t
according to the rules of the coded character set defined by character
type information in the current locale
or in the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively (category
.IR LC_CTYPE ).
.P
The values returned by
\fIwctype\fR()
shall be valid until a call to
\fIsetlocale\fR()
that modifies the category
.IR LC_CTYPE .
.P
The values returned by
\fIwctype_l\fR()
shall be valid only in calls to
\fIiswctype_l\fR()
with a locale represented by
.IR locale
with the same
.IR LC_CTYPE
category value.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the
.IR locale
argument to
\fIwctype_l\fR()
is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
object handle.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIwctype\fR()
and
\fIwctype_l\fR()
functions shall return 0 if the given character class name is not
valid for the current locale (category
.IR LC_CTYPE );
otherwise, they shall return an object of type
.BR wctype_t
that can be used in calls to
\fIiswctype\fR()
and
\fIiswctype_l\fR().
