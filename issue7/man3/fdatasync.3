.SH NAME
fdatasync
\(em synchronize the data of a file
(\fBREALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>
.P
int fdatasync(int \fIfildes\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIfdatasync\fR()
function shall force all currently queued I/O operations associated
with the file indicated by file descriptor
.IR fildes
to the synchronized I/O completion state.
.P
The functionality shall be equivalent to
\fIfsync\fR()
with the symbol _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO defined,
with the exception that all I/O operations shall be completed as
defined for synchronized I/O data integrity completion.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If successful, the
\fIfdatasync\fR()
function shall return the value 0; otherwise, the function shall return
the value \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error. If the
\fIfdatasync\fR()
function fails, outstanding I/O operations are not guaranteed to have
been completed.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIfdatasync\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The
.IR fildes
argument is not a valid file descriptor open for writing.
.TP
.BR EINVAL
This implementation does not support synchronized I/O for this file.
.P
In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail,
\fIfdatasync\fR()
shall return the error conditions defined for
\fIread\fR()
and
\fIwrite\fR().
