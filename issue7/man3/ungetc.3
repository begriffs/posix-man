.SH NAME
ungetc
\(em push byte back into input stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
.P
int ungetc(int \fIc\fP, FILE *\fIstream\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIungetc\fR()
function shall push the byte specified by
.IR c
(converted to an
.BR "unsigned char" )
back onto the input stream pointed to by
.IR stream .
The pushed-back bytes shall be returned by subsequent reads on that
stream in the reverse order of their pushing. A successful intervening
call (with the stream pointed to by
.IR stream )
to a file-positioning function (\c
\fIfseek\fR(),
\c
\fIfseeko\fR(),
\fIfsetpos\fR(),
or
\fIrewind\fR())
or
\fIfflush\fR()
shall discard any pushed-back bytes for the stream. The external
storage corresponding to the stream shall be unchanged.
.P
One byte of push-back shall be provided. If
\fIungetc\fR()
is called too many times on the same stream without an intervening read
or file-positioning operation on that stream, the operation may fail.
.P
If the value of
.IR c
equals that of the macro EOF, the operation shall fail and the input
stream shall be left unchanged.
.P
A successful call to
\fIungetc\fR()
shall clear the end-of-file indicator for the stream. The value of the
file-position indicator for the stream after all pushed-back bytes have
been read, or discarded by calling
\fIfseek\fR(),
\fIfseeko\fR(),
\fIfsetpos\fR(),
or
\fIrewind\fR()
(but not
\fIfflush\fR()),
shall be the same as it was before the bytes were pushed back. The
file-position indicator is decremented by each successful call to
\fIungetc\fR();
if its value was 0 before a call, its value is unspecified after the call.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIungetc\fR()
shall return the byte pushed back after conversion. Otherwise, it
shall return EOF.
