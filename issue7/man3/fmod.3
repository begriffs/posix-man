fmod,
fmodf,

\(em floating-point remainder value function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double fmod(double \fIx\fP, double \fIy\fP);
float fmodf(float \fIx\fP, float \fIy\fP);
long double fmodl(long double \fIx\fP, long double \fIy\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall return the floating-point remainder of the
division of
.IR x
by
.IR y .
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
These functions shall return the value
.IR x \(mi\c
.IR i *\c
.IR y ,
for some integer
.IR i
such that, if
.IR y
is non-zero, the result has the same sign as
.IR x
and magnitude less than the magnitude of
.IR y .
.P
If the correct value would cause underflow,
and is not
representable,
a range error may occur, and
\fIfmod\fR(),
\fImodf\fR(),
and
\fIfmodl\fR()
shall return
0.0, or
(if the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option is not supported) an
implementation-defined value no greater in magnitude than DBL_MIN,
FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
or
.IR y
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR y
is zero, a domain error shall occur, and a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is infinite, a domain error shall occur, and a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0 and
.IR y
is not zero, \(+-0 shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is not infinite and
.IR y
is \(+-Inf,
.IR x
shall be returned.
.P
If the correct value would cause underflow, and is representable, a
range error may occur and the correct value shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Domain\ Error" 12
The
.IR x
argument is infinite or
.IR y
is zero.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EDOM] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.P
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result underflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
