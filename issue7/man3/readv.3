.SH NAME
readv
\(em read a vector
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <sys/uio.h>
.P
ssize_t readv(int \fIfildes\fP, const struct iovec *\fIiov\fP, int \fIiovcnt\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIreadv\fR()
function shall be equivalent to
\fIread\fR(),
except as described below. The
\fIreadv\fR()
function shall place the input data into the
.IR iovcnt
buffers specified by the members of the
.IR iov
array:
.IR iov [0],
.IR iov [1],
\&.\|.\|.,
.IR iov [\c
.IR iovcnt \(mi1].
The
.IR iovcnt
argument is valid if greater than 0 and less than or equal to
{IOV_MAX}.
.P
Each
.IR iovec
entry specifies the base address and length of an area
in memory where data should be placed. The
\fIreadv\fR()
function shall always fill an area completely before proceeding
to the next.
.P
Upon successful completion,
\fIreadv\fR()
shall mark for update the last data access timestamp of the file.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Refer to
.IR "\fIread\fR\^(\|)".
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIread\fR\^(\|)".
.P
In addition, the
\fIreadv\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The sum of the
.IR iov_len
values in the
.IR iov
array overflowed an
.BR ssize_t .
.P
The
\fIreadv\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR iovcnt
argument was less than or equal to 0, or greater than
{IOV_MAX}.

.P
The following example reads data from the file associated with the file
descriptor
.IR fd
into the buffers specified by members of the

array.
