.SH NAME
pthread_barrierattr_destroy,
pthread_barrierattr_init
\(em destroy and initialize the barrier attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <pthread.h>
.P
int pthread_barrierattr_destroy(pthread_barrierattr_t *\fIattr\fP);
int pthread_barrierattr_init(pthread_barrierattr_t *\fIattr\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIpthread_barrierattr_destroy\fR()
function shall destroy a barrier attributes object. A destroyed
.IR attr
attributes object can be reinitialized using
\fIpthread_barrierattr_init\fR();
the results of otherwise referencing the object after it
has been destroyed are undefined. An implementation may cause
\fIpthread_barrierattr_destroy\fR()
to set the object referenced by
.IR attr
to an invalid value.
.P
The
\fIpthread_barrierattr_init\fR()
function shall initialize a barrier attributes object
.IR attr
with the default value for all of the attributes defined by the
implementation.
.P
If
\fIpthread_barrierattr_init\fR()
is called specifying an already initialized
.IR attr
attributes object, the results are undefined.
.P
After a barrier attributes object has been used to initialize one or
more barriers, any function affecting the attributes object (including
destruction) shall not affect any previously initialized barrier.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_barrierattr_destroy\fR()
does not refer to an initialized barrier attributes object.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If successful, the
\fIpthread_barrierattr_destroy\fR()
and
\fIpthread_barrierattr_init\fR()
functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIpthread_barrierattr_init\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the barrier attributes
object.
.P
These functions shall not return an error code of
.BR [EINTR] .
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_barrierattr_destroy\fR()
does not refer to an initialized barrier attributes object, it is
recommended that the function should fail and report an
.BR [EINVAL] 
error.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
