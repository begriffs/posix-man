.SH NAME
pthread_condattr_destroy,
pthread_condattr_init
\(em destroy and initialize the condition variable attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <pthread.h>
.P
int pthread_condattr_destroy(pthread_condattr_t *\fIattr\fP);
int pthread_condattr_init(pthread_condattr_t *\fIattr\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIpthread_condattr_destroy\fR()
function shall destroy a condition variable attributes object; the
object becomes, in effect, uninitialized. An implementation may cause
\fIpthread_condattr_destroy\fR()
to set the object referenced by
.IR attr
to an invalid value. A destroyed
.IR attr
attributes object can be reinitialized using
\fIpthread_condattr_init\fR();
the results of otherwise referencing the object after it
has been destroyed are undefined.
.P
The
\fIpthread_condattr_init\fR()
function shall initialize a condition variable attributes object
.IR attr
with the default value for all of the attributes defined by the
implementation.
.P
Results are undefined if
\fIpthread_condattr_init\fR()
is called specifying an already initialized
.IR attr
attributes object.
.P
After a condition variable attributes object has been used to
initialize one or more condition variables, any function affecting the
attributes object (including destruction) shall not affect any
previously initialized condition variables.
.P
This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 requires two attributes, the
.IR clock
attribute and the
.IR process-shared
attribute.
.P
Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the
associated functions to get and set those attribute values are
implementation-defined.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_condattr_destroy\fR()
does not refer to an initialized condition variable attributes object.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If successful, the
\fIpthread_condattr_destroy\fR()
and
\fIpthread_condattr_init\fR()
functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIpthread_condattr_init\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the condition variable
attributes object.
.P
These functions shall not return an error code of
.BR [EINTR] .
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
A
.IR process-shared
attribute has been defined for condition variables for the same reason
it has been defined for mutexes.
.P
If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_condattr_destroy\fR()
does not refer to an initialized condition variable attributes object,
it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
.BR [EINVAL] 
error.
