.SH NAME
log1p,

\(em compute a natural logarithm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

#include <math.h>
.P
double log1p(double \fIx\fP);
float log1pf(float \fIx\fP);
long double log1pl(long double \fIx\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute log\d\s-3e\s+3\u(1.0 + \fIx\fP).
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the natural
logarithm of 1.0 +
.IR x .
.P
If
.IR x
is \(mi1, a pole error shall occur and
\fIlog1p\fR(),
\fIlog1pf\fR(),
and
\fIlog1pl\fR()
shall return \(miHUGE_VAL, \(miHUGE_VALF, and \(miHUGE_VALL,
respectively.
.P
For finite values of
.IR x
that are less than \(mi1,
or if
.IR x
is \(miInf,
a domain error shall occur, and
either a NaN (if supported), or
an implementation-defined value shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0, or +Inf,
.IR x
shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is subnormal, a range error may occur
.br
and
.IR x
should be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is not returned,
\fIlog1p\fR(),
\fIlog1pf\fR(),
and
\fIlog1pl\fR()
shall return an implementation-defined value no greater in magnitude
than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Domain\ Error" 12
The finite value of
.IR x
is less than \(mi1,
or
.IR x
is \(miInf.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [EDOM] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.IP "Pole\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is \(mi1.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the divide-by-zero floating-point exception shall be
raised.
.RE
.br
.P
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is subnormal.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
