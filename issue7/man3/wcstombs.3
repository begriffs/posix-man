.SH NAME
wcstombs
\(em convert a wide-character string to a character string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>
.P
size_t wcstombs(char *restrict \fIs\fP, const wchar_t *restrict \fIpwcs\fP,
    size_t \fIn\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIwcstombs\fR()
function shall convert the sequence of wide-character codes that are
in the array pointed to by
.IR pwcs
into a sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift state
and store these characters into the array pointed to by
.IR s ,
stopping if a character would exceed the limit of
.IR n
total bytes or if a null byte is stored. Each wide-character code
shall be converted as if by a call to
\fIwctomb\fR(),
except that the shift state of
\fIwctomb\fR()
shall not be affected.
.P
The behavior of this function shall be affected by the
.IR LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale.
.P
No more than
.IR n
bytes shall be modified in the array pointed to by
.IR s .
If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
undefined.
If
.IR s
is a null pointer,
\fIwcstombs\fR()
shall return the length required to convert the entire array
regardless of the value of
.IR n ,
but no values are stored.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If a wide-character code is encountered that does not correspond to a
valid character (of one or more bytes each),
\fIwcstombs\fR()
shall return (\fBsize_t\fP)\(mi1. Otherwise,
\fIwcstombs\fR()
shall return the number of bytes stored in the character array, not
including any terminating null byte. The array shall not be
null-terminated if the value returned is
.IR n .
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIwcstombs\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EILSEQ
A wide-character code does not correspond to a valid character.
