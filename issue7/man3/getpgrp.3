.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <unistd.h>
.P
pid_t getpgrp(void);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIgetpgrp\fR()
function shall return the process group ID of the calling process.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIgetpgrp\fR()
function shall always be successful and no return value is reserved
to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.

.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
4.3 BSD provides a
\fIgetpgrp\fR()
function that returns the process group ID
for a specified process. Although this function supports job
control, all
known job control shells always specify the calling
process with this function. Thus, the simpler System V
\fIgetpgrp\fR()
suffices, and the added complexity of the 4.3 BSD
\fIgetpgrp\fR()
is provided by the XSI extension
\fIgetpgid\fR().
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
