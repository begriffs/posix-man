.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wchar.h>
.P
size_t wcslen(const wchar_t *\fIws\fP);
size_t wcsnlen(const wchar_t *\fIws\fP, size_t \fImaxlen\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fIwcslen\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIwcslen\fR()
function shall compute the number of wide-character codes in the
wide-character string to which
.IR ws
points, not including the terminating null wide-character code.
.P
The
\fIwcsnlen\fR()
function shall compute the smaller of the number of wide characters in
the string to which
.IR ws
points, not including the terminating null wide-character code, and the
value of
.IR maxlen .
The
\fIwcsnlen\fR()
function shall never examine more than the first
.IR maxlen
characters of the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIwcslen\fR()
function shall return the length of
.IR ws .
.P
The
\fIwcsnlen\fR()
function shall return an integer containing the smaller of either the
length of the wide-character string pointed to by
.IR ws
or
.IR maxlen .
.P
No return values are reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
