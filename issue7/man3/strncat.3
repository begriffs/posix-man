.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIstrncat\fR()
function shall append not more than
.IR n
bytes (a NUL character and bytes that follow it are not appended)
from the array pointed to by
.IR s2
to the end of the string pointed to by
.IR s1 .
The initial byte of
.IR s2
overwrites the NUL character at the end of
.IR s1 .
A terminating NUL character is always appended to the result. If copying
takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIstrncat\fR()
function shall return
.IR s1 ;
no return value shall be reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
