.SH NAME
fgetws
\(em get a wide-character string from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
.P
wchar_t *fgetws(wchar_t *restrict \fIws\fP, int \fIn\fP,
    FILE *restrict \fIstream\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIfgetws\fR()
function shall read characters from the
.IR stream ,
convert these to the corresponding wide-character codes, place them
in the
.BR wchar_t
array pointed to by
.IR ws ,
until
.IR n \(mi1
characters are read, or a
<newline>
is read, converted, and transferred to
.IR ws ,
or an end-of-file condition is encountered. The wide-character string,
.IR ws ,
shall then be terminated with a null wide-character code.
.P
If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator
for the stream is unspecified.
.P
The
\fIfgetws\fR()
function may mark the last data access timestamp of the file
associated with
.IR stream
for update. The last data access timestamp shall be marked for update
by the first successful execution of
\fIfgetwc\fR(),
\fIfgetws\fR(),
\fIfwscanf\fR(),
\fIgetwc\fR(),
\fIgetwchar\fR(),
\fIvfwscanf\fR(),
\fIvwscanf\fR(),
or
\fIwscanf\fR()
using
.IR stream
that returns data not supplied by a prior call to
\fIungetwc\fR().
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIfgetws\fR()
shall return
.IR ws .
If the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set, or if the stream
is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the
stream shall be set and
\fIfgetws\fR()
shall return a null pointer. If a read error occurs, the error
indicator for the stream shall be set,
\fIfgetws\fR()
shall return a null pointer,
and shall set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIfgetwc\fR\^(\|)".
