.nf
#include <string.h>
.P
int memcmp(const void *\fIs1\fP, const void *\fIs2\fP, size_t \fIn\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fImemcmp\fR()
function shall compare the first
.IR n
bytes (each interpreted as
.BR "unsigned char" )
of the object pointed to by
.IR s1
to the first
.IR n
bytes of the object pointed to by
.IR s2 .
.P
The sign of a non-zero return value shall be determined by the sign of
the difference between the values of the first pair of bytes (both
interpreted as type
.BR "unsigned char" )
that differ in the objects being compared.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fImemcmp\fR()
function shall return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than
0, if the object pointed to by
.IR s1
is greater than, equal to, or less than the object pointed to by
.IR s2 ,
respectively.
