.SH NAME
assert
\(em insert program diagnostics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <assert.h>
.P
void assert(scalar \fIexpression\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIassert\fR()
macro shall insert diagnostics into programs; it shall expand to a
.BR void
expression. When it is executed, if
.IR expression
(which shall have a
.BR scalar
type) is false (that is, compares equal to 0),
\fIassert\fR()
shall write information about the particular call that failed on
.IR stderr
and shall call
\fIabort\fR().
.P
The information written about the call that failed shall include the
text of the argument, the name of the source file, the source file line
number, and the name of the enclosing function; the latter are,
respectively, the values of the preprocessing macros _\|_FILE_\|_ and
_\|_LINE_\|_
and of the identifier _\|_func_\|_.
.P
Forcing a definition of the name NDEBUG,
either from the compiler command line or with the preprocessor control
statement
.BR #define
NDEBUG ahead of the
.BR #include
.IR <assert.h> 
statement, shall stop assertions from being compiled into the program.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIassert\fR()
macro shall not return a value.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
