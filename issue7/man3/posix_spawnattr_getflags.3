.SH NAME
posix_spawnattr_getflags,
posix_spawnattr_setflags
\(em get and set the spawn-flags attribute of a spawn attributes object
(\fBADVANCED REALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <spawn.h>
.P
int posix_spawnattr_getflags(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict \fIattr\fP,
    short *restrict \fIflags\fP);
int posix_spawnattr_setflags(posix_spawnattr_t *\fIattr\fP, short \fIflags\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIposix_spawnattr_getflags\fR()
function shall obtain the value of the
.IR spawn-flags
attribute from the attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
.P
The
\fIposix_spawnattr_setflags\fR()
function shall set the
.IR spawn-flags
attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
.P
The
.IR spawn-flags
attribute is used to indicate which process attributes are to be
changed in the new process image when invoking
\fIposix_spawn\fR()
or
\fIposix_spawnp\fR().
It is the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the following flags:
.P
.nf
POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS
POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER
.fi
.P
These flags are defined in
.IR <spawn.h> .
The default value of this attribute shall be as if no flags were set.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIposix_spawnattr_getflags\fR()
shall return zero and store the value of the
.IR spawn-flags
attribute of
.IR attr
into the object referenced by the
.IR flags
parameter; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.
.P
Upon successful completion,
\fIposix_spawnattr_setflags\fR()
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value specified by
.IR attr
is invalid.
.P
The
\fIposix_spawnattr_setflags\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of the attribute being set is not valid.
.LP

provided on all implementations.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
