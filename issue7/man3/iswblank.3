.SH NAME
iswblank,
iswblank_l
\(em test for a blank wide-character code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <wctype.h>
.P
int iswblank(wint_t \fIwc\fP);
int iswblank_l(wint_t \fIwc\fP, locale_t \fIlocale\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
For
\fIiswblank\fR():
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIiswblank\fR()
and
\fIiswblank\fR()
functions shall test whether
.IR wc
is a wide-character code representing a character of class
.BR blank
in the current locale,
or in the locale represented by
.IR locale ,
respectively; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008,
.IR "Chapter 7" ", " "Locale".
.P
The
.IR wc
argument is a
.BR wint_t ,
the value of which the application shall ensure is a wide-character
code corresponding to a valid character in the current locale, or equal
to the value of the macro WEOF. If the argument has any other value,
the behavior is undefined.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the
.IR locale
argument to
\fIiswblank_l\fR()
is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
object handle.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIiswblank\fR()
and
\fIiswblank_l\fR()
functions shall return non-zero if
.IR wc
is a blank wide-character code; otherwise, they shall return 0.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
To ensure applications portability, especially across natural
languages, only these functions and the functions in the reference pages
listed in the SEE ALSO section should be used for character classification.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
