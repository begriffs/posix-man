.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double hypot(double \fIx\fP, double \fIy\fP);
float hypotf(float \fIx\fP, float \fIy\fP);
long double hypotl(long double \fIx\fP, long double \fIy\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute the value of the square root of
.IR x \s-3\u2\d\s+3+\c
.IR y \s-3\u2\d\s+3
without undue overflow or underflow.
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the length of
the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of length
.IR x
and
.IR y .
.P
If the correct value would cause overflow, a range error shall occur
and
\fIhypot\fR(),
\fIhypotf\fR(),
and
\fIhypotl\fR()
shall return the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, and HUGE_VALL,
respectively.
.P
If
.IR x
or
.IR y
is \(+-Inf, +Inf shall be returned (even if one of
.IR x
or
.IR y
is NaN).
.P
If
.IR x
or
.IR y
is NaN, and the other is not \(+-Inf, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If both arguments are subnormal and the correct result is subnormal,
a range error may occur and the correct result shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result overflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the overflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.P
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The result underflows.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
See the EXAMPLES section in
\fIatan2\fR().
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
\fIhypot\fR(\fIx\fR,\fIy\fR), \fIhypot\fR(\fIy\fR,\fIx\fR), and
\fIhypot\fR(\fIx\fR, \(mi\fIy\fR) are equivalent.
.P
\fIhypot\fR(\fIx\fR, \(+-0) is equivalent to \fIfabs\fR(\fIx\fR).
.P
Underflow only happens when both
.IR x
and
.IR y
are subnormal and the (inexact) result is also subnormal.
.P
These functions take precautions against overflow during intermediate
steps of the computation.
.P
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
