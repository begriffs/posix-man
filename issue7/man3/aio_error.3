.SH NAME
aio_error
\(em retrieve errors status for an asynchronous I/O operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <aio.h>
.P
int aio_error(const struct aiocb *\fIaiocbp\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIaio_error\fR()
function shall return the error status associated with the
.BR aiocb
structure referenced by the
.IR aiocbp
argument. The error status for an asynchronous I/O operation is the
.IR errno
value that would be set by the corresponding
\fIread\fR(),
\fIwrite\fR(),
\fIfdatasync\fR(),
or
\fIfsync\fR()
operation. If the operation has not yet completed, then the error
status shall be equal to
.BR [EINPROGRESS] .
.P
If the
.BR aiocb
structure pointed to by
.IR aiocbp
is not associated with an operation that has been scheduled, the
results are undefined.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If the asynchronous I/O operation has completed successfully, then 0
shall be returned. If the asynchronous operation has completed
unsuccessfully, then the error status, as described for
\fIread\fR(),
\fIwrite\fR(),
\fIfdatasync\fR(),
and
\fIfsync\fR(),
shall be returned. If the asynchronous I/O operation has not yet
completed, then
.BR [EINPROGRESS] 
shall be returned.
.P
If the
\fIaio_error\fR()
function fails, it shall return \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIaio_error\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The
.IR aiocbp
argument does not refer to an asynchronous operation whose return
status has not yet been retrieved.
