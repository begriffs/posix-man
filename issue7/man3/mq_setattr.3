.SH NAME
mq_setattr
\(em set message queue attributes
(\fBREALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <mqueue.h>
.P
int mq_setattr(mqd_t \fImqdes\fP, const struct mq_attr *restrict \fImqstat\fP,
    struct mq_attr *restrict \fIomqstat\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fImq_setattr\fR()
function shall set attributes associated with the open message queue
description referenced by the message queue descriptor specified by
.IR mqdes .
.P
The message queue attributes corresponding to the following members
defined in the
.BR mq_attr
structure shall be set to the specified values upon successful
completion of
\fImq_setattr\fR():
.IP "\fImq_flags\fP" 12
The value of this member is the bitwise-logical OR of zero or more of
O_NONBLOCK and any implementation-defined flags.
.P
The values of the
.IR mq_maxmsg ,
.IR mq_msgsize ,
and
.IR mq_curmsgs
members of the
.BR mq_attr
structure shall be ignored by
\fImq_setattr\fR().
.P
If
.IR omqstat
is non-NULL, the
\fImq_setattr\fR()
function shall store, in the location referenced by
.IR omqstat ,
the previous message queue attributes and the current queue status.
These values shall be the same as would be returned by a call to
\fImq_getattr\fR()
at that point.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the function shall return a value of zero
and the attributes of the message queue shall have been changed as
specified.
.P
Otherwise, the message queue attributes shall be unchanged, and the
function shall return a value of \(mi1 and set
.IR errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fImq_setattr\fR()
function shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EBADF
The
.IR mqdes
argument is not a valid message queue descriptor.
