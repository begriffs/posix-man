.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIimaxdiv\fR()
function shall compute \fInumer\fR\ /\ \fIdenom\fR and
\fInumer\fR\ %\ \fIdenom\fR in a single operation.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIimaxdiv\fR()
function shall return a structure of type
.BR imaxdiv_t ,
comprising both the quotient and the remainder. The structure shall
contain (in either order) the members
.IR quot
(the quotient) and
.IR rem
(the remainder), each of which has type
.BR intmax_t .
.P
If either part of the result cannot be represented, the behavior is
undefined.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
