.SH NAME
tanh,
tanhf,
tanhl
\(em hyperbolic tangent functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double tanh(double \fIx\fP);
float tanhf(float \fIx\fP);
long double tanhl(long double \fIx\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute the hyperbolic tangent of their argument
.IR x .
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the hyperbolic
tangent of
.IR x .
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0,
.IR x
shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-Inf, \(+-1 shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is subnormal, a range error may occur
.br
and
.IR x
should be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is not returned,
\fItanh\fR(),
\fItanhf\fR(),
and
\fItanhl\fR()
shall return an implementation-defined value no greater in magnitude
than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN, respectively.
.SH ERRORS
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Range\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is subnormal.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the underflow floating-point exception shall be raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
