.SH NAME
wcstoimax,
wcstoumax
\(em convert a wide-character string to an integer type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stddef.h>
#include <inttypes.h>
.P
intmax_t wcstoimax(const wchar_t *restrict \fInptr\fP,
    wchar_t **restrict \fIendptr\fP, int \fIbase\fP);
uintmax_t wcstoumax(const wchar_t *restrict \fInptr\fP,
    wchar_t **restrict \fIendptr\fP, int \fIbase\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall be equivalent to the
\fIwcstol\fR(),
\fIwcstoll\fR(),
\fIwcstoul\fR(),
and
\fIwcstoull\fR()
functions, respectively, except that the initial portion of the wide
string shall be converted to
.BR intmax_t
and
.BR uintmax_t
representation, respectively.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
These functions shall return the converted value, if any.
.P
If no conversion could be performed, zero shall be returned. If the
correct value is outside the range of representable values,
{INTMAX_MAX},
{INTMAX_MIN},
or
{UINTMAX_MAX}
shall be returned (according to the return type and sign of the value,
if any), and
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of
.IR base
is not supported.
.TP
.BR ERANGE
The value to be returned is not representable.
.P
These functions may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
No conversion could be performed.
