.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIvdprintf\fR(),
\fIvfprintf\fR(),
\fIvprintf\fR(),
\fIvsnprintf\fR(),
and
\fIvsprintf\fR()
functions shall be equivalent to the \&
\fIdprintf\fR(),
\fIfprintf\fR(),
\fIprintf\fR(),
\fIsnprintf\fR(),
and
\fIsprintf\fR()
functions respectively, except that instead of being called with a
variable number of arguments, they are called with an argument list as
defined by
.IR <stdarg.h> .
.P
These functions shall not invoke the
.IR va_end
macro. As these functions invoke the
.IR va_arg
macro, the value of
.IR ap
after the return is unspecified.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Refer to
.IR "\fIfprintf\fR\^(\|)".
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIfprintf\fR\^(\|)".
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Applications using these functions should call \fIva_end\fP(\fIap\fP)
afterwards to clean up.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
