.SH NAME
pthread_equal
\(em compare thread IDs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <pthread.h>
.P
int pthread_equal(pthread_t \fIt1\fP, pthread_t \fIt2\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function shall compare the thread IDs
.IR t1
and
.IR t2 .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The
\fIpthread_equal\fR()
function shall return a non-zero value if
.IR t1
and
.IR t2
are equal; otherwise, zero shall be returned.
.P
If either
.IR t1
or
.IR t2
are not valid thread IDs, the behavior is undefined.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.P
The
\fIpthread_equal\fR()
function shall not return an error code of
.BR [EINTR] .
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
Implementations may choose to define a
thread ID as a structure. This allows additional flexibility and
robustness over using an
.BR int .
For example, a thread ID could include a sequence number that allows
detection of ``dangling IDs'' (copies of a thread ID that has been
detached). Since the C language does not support comparison on
structure types, the
\fIpthread_equal\fR()
function is provided to compare thread IDs.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
