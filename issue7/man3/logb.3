logb,

\(em radix-independent exponent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

#include <math.h>
.P
double logb(double \fIx\fP);
float logbf(float \fIx\fP);
long double logbl(long double \fIx\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall compute the exponent of
.IR x ,
which is the integral part of log\fI\d\s-3r\s+3\u\fR
|\|\fIx\fR\||, as a signed floating-point value, for non-zero
.IR x ,
where
.IR r
is the radix of the machine's floating-point arithmetic, which is the
value of FLT_RADIX defined in the
.IR <float.h> 
header.
.P
If
.IR x
is subnormal it is treated as though it were normalized; thus for
finite positive
.IR x :
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
1 <= \fIx\fP * FLT_RADIX\s-3\u\(milogb(x)\d\s+3 < FLT_RADIX
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
An application wishing to check for error situations should set
.IR errno
to zero and call
.IR feclearexcept (FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
before calling these functions. On return, if
.IR errno
is non-zero or \fIfetestexcept\fR(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO |
FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the exponent
of
.IR x .
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-0,
\fIlogb\fR(),
\fIlogbf\fR(),
and
\fIlogbl\fR()
shall return \(miHUGE_VAL, \(miHUGE_VALF, and \(miHUGE_VALL,
respectively.
.P
On systems that support the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, a pole
error shall occur;
.br
otherwise, a
pole
error may occur.
.P
If
.IR x
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.P
If
.IR x
is \(+-Inf, +Inf shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.IP "Pole\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is \(+-0.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the divide-by-zero floating-point exception shall be
raised.
.RE
.P
These functions may fail if:
.IP "Pole\ Error" 12
The value of
.IR x
is 0.
.RS 12 
.P
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, then
.IR errno
shall be set to
.BR [ERANGE] .
If the integer expression (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, then the divide-by-zero floating-point exception shall be
raised.
.RE
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
On error, the expressions (\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERRNO) and
(\fImath_errhandling\fR & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
