.SH NAME
copysign,
copysignf,
copysignl
\(em number manipulation function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double copysign(double \fIx\fP, double \fIy\fP);
float copysignf(float \fIx\fP, float \fIy\fP);
long double copysignl(long double \fIx\fP, long double \fIy\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall produce a value with the magnitude of
.IR x
and the sign of
.IR y .
On implementations that represent a signed zero but do not treat
negative zero consistently in arithmetic operations, these functions
regard the sign of zero as positive.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value with
the magnitude of
.IR x
and the sign of
.IR y .
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
