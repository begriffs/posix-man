.SH NAME
pthread_condattr_getclock,
pthread_condattr_setclock
\(em get and set the clock selection condition variable attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <pthread.h>
.P
int pthread_condattr_getclock(const pthread_condattr_t *restrict \fIattr\fP,
    clockid_t *restrict \fIclock_id\fP);
int pthread_condattr_setclock(pthread_condattr_t *\fIattr\fP,
    clockid_t \fIclock_id\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIpthread_condattr_getclock\fR()
function shall obtain the value of the
.IR clock
attribute from the attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
.P
The
\fIpthread_condattr_setclock\fR()
function shall set the
.IR clock
attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
If
\fIpthread_condattr_setclock\fR()
is called with a
.IR clock_id
argument that refers to a CPU-time clock, the call shall fail.
.P
The
.IR clock
attribute is the clock ID of the clock that shall be used to
measure the timeout service of
\fIpthread_cond_timedwait\fR().
The default value of the
.IR clock
attribute shall refer to the system clock.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_condattr_getclock\fR()
or
\fIpthread_condattr_setclock\fR()
does not refer to an initialized condition variable attributes object.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If successful, the
\fIpthread_condattr_getclock\fR()
function shall return zero and store the value of the clock attribute
of
.IR attr
into the object referenced by the
.IR clock_id
argument. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error.
.P
If successful, the
\fIpthread_condattr_setclock\fR()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIpthread_condattr_setclock\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value specified by
.IR clock_id
does not refer to a known clock, or is a CPU-time clock.
.P
These functions shall not return an error code of
.BR [EINTR] .
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_condattr_getclock\fR()
or
\fIpthread_condattr_setclock\fR()
does not refer to an initialized condition variable attributes object,
it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
.BR [EINVAL] 
error.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
