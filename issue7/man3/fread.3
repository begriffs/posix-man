.SH NAME
fread
\(em binary input
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
.P
size_t fread(void *restrict \fIptr\fP, size_t \fIsize\fP, size_t \fInitems\fP,
    FILE *restrict \fIstream\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
The
\fIfread\fR()
function shall read into the array pointed to by
.IR ptr
up to
.IR nitems
elements whose size is specified by
.IR size
in bytes, from the stream pointed to by
.IR stream .
For each object,
.IR size
calls shall be made to the
\fIfgetc\fR()
function and the results stored, in the order read, in an array of
.BR "unsigned char"
exactly overlaying the object. The file position indicator for the
stream (if defined) shall be advanced by the number of bytes
successfully read. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file
position indicator for the stream is unspecified. If a partial element
is read, its value is unspecified.
.P
The
\fIfread\fR()
function may mark the last data access timestamp of the file
associated with
.IR stream
for update. The last data access timestamp shall be
marked for update by the first successful execution of
\fIfgetc\fR(),
\fIfgets\fR(),
\fIfread\fR(),
\fIfscanf\fR(),
\fIgetc\fR(),
\fIgetchar\fR(),
\fIgetdelim\fR(),
\fIgetline\fR(),
\fIgets\fR(),
or
\fIscanf\fR()
using
.IR stream
that returns data not supplied by a prior call to
\fIungetc\fR().
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion,
\fIfread\fR()
shall return the number of elements successfully read which is less than
.IR nitems
only if a read error or end-of-file is encountered. If
.IR size
or
.IR nitems
is 0,
\fIfread\fR()
shall return 0 and the contents of the array and the state of the
stream remain unchanged. Otherwise, if a read error occurs, the error
indicator for the stream shall be set,
and
.IR errno
shall be set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
Refer to
.IR "\fIfgetc\fR\^(\|)".
.LP

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "Reading from a Stream"
.P
The following example reads a single element from the
.IR fp
stream into the array pointed to by
.IR buf .
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
#include <stdio.h>
\&...
size_t elements_read;
char buf[100];
FILE *fp;
\&...
elements_read = fread(buf, sizeof(buf), 1, fp);
\&...
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
If a read error occurs,
.IR elements_read
will be zero but the number of bytes read from the stream could be
anything from zero to
.IR sizeof ( buf )\(mi1.
.P
The following example reads multiple single-byte elements from the
.IR fp
stream into the array pointed to by
.IR buf .
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fB
#include <stdio.h>
\&...
size_t bytes_read;
char buf[100];
FILE *fp;
\&...
bytes_read = fread(buf, 1, sizeof(buf), fp);
\&...
.fi \fR
.P
.RE
.P
If a read error occurs,
.IR bytes_read
will contain the number of bytes read from the stream.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIferror\fR()
or
\fIfeof\fR()
functions must be used to distinguish between an error condition and an
end-of-file condition.
.P
Because of possible differences in element length and byte ordering,
files written using
\fIfwrite\fR()
are application-dependent, and possibly cannot be read using
\fIfread\fR()
by a different application or by the same application on a different
processor.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
