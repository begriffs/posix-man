.SH NAME
posix_trace_start,
posix_trace_stop
\(em trace start and stop
(\fBTRACING\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <trace.h>
.P
int posix_trace_start(trace_id_t \fItrid\fP);
int posix_trace_stop (trace_id_t \fItrid\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIposix_trace_start\fR()
and
\fIposix_trace_stop\fR()
functions, respectively, shall start and stop the trace stream
identified by the argument
.IR trid .
.P
The effect of calling the
\fIposix_trace_start\fR()
function shall be recorded in the trace stream as the POSIX_TRACE_START
system trace event and the status of the trace stream shall become
POSIX_TRACE_RUNNING.
If the trace stream is in progress when this function is called, the
POSIX_TRACE_START
system trace event shall not be recorded and the trace stream shall
continue to run. If the trace stream is full, the POSIX_TRACE_START
system trace event shall not be recorded and the status of the trace
stream shall not be changed.
.P
The effect of calling the
\fIposix_trace_stop\fR()
function shall be recorded in the trace stream as the POSIX_TRACE_STOP
system trace event and the status of the trace stream shall become
POSIX_TRACE_SUSPENDED.
If the trace stream is suspended when this function is called, the
POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event shall not be recorded and the trace
stream shall remain suspended. If the trace stream is full, the
POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event shall not be recorded and the
status of the trace stream shall not be changed.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value of
zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error number.
.SH ERRORS
These functions shall fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The value of the argument
.IR trid
does not correspond to an active trace stream and thus no trace stream
was started or stopped.
.TP
.BR EINTR
The operation was interrupted by a signal and thus the trace stream was
not necessarily started or stopped.

.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
None.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
The
\fIposix_trace_start\fR()
and
\fIposix_trace_stop\fR()
functions may be removed in a future version.
