.SH NAME
frexp,
frexpf,
frexpl
\(em extract mantissa and exponent from a double precision number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <math.h>
.P
double frexp(double \fInum\fP, int *\fIexp\fP);
float frexpf(float \fInum\fP, int *\fIexp\fP);
long double frexpl(long double \fInum\fP, int *\fIexp\fP);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the
ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the
ISO\ C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1\(hy2008 defers to the ISO\ C standard.
.P
These functions shall break a floating-point number
.IR num
into a normalized fraction and an integral power of 2. The integer
exponent shall be stored in the
.BR int
object pointed to by
.IR exp .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
For finite arguments, these functions shall return the value
.IR x ,
such that
.IR x
has a magnitude in the interval [\(12,1) or 0, and
.IR num
equals
.IR x
times 2 raised to the power *\fIexp\fP.
.P
If
.IR num
is NaN, a NaN shall be returned, and the value of *\fIexp\fP is
unspecified.
.P
If
.IR num
is \(+-0, \(+-0 shall be returned, and the value of *\fIexp\fP shall be
0.
.P
If
.IR num
is \(+-Inf,
.IR num
shall be returned, and the value of *\fIexp\fP is unspecified.
.SH ERRORS
No errors are defined.
