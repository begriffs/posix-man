.SH NAME
pthread_barrierattr_getpshared,
pthread_barrierattr_setpshared
\(em get and set the process-shared attribute of the barrier
attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
#include <pthread.h>
.P
int pthread_barrierattr_getpshared(const pthread_barrierattr_t
    *restrict \fIattr\fP, int *restrict \fIpshared\fP);
int pthread_barrierattr_setpshared(pthread_barrierattr_t *\fIattr\fP,
    int \fIpshared\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIpthread_barrierattr_getpshared\fR()
function shall obtain the value of the
.IR process-shared
attribute from the attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
The
\fIpthread_barrierattr_setpshared\fR()
function shall set the
.IR process-shared
attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by
.IR attr .
.P
The
.IR process-shared
attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to
permit a barrier to be operated upon by any thread that has access to
the memory where the barrier is allocated. If the
.IR process-shared
attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the barrier shall only be
operated upon by
threads created within the same process as the thread that initialized
the barrier; if threads of different processes attempt to operate on
such a barrier, the behavior is undefined. The default value of the
attribute shall be PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE. Both constants
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED and PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE are defined in
.IR <pthread.h> .
.P
Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the
associated functions to get and set those attribute values are
implementation-defined.
.P
The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_barrierattr_getpshared\fR()
or
\fIpthread_barrierattr_setpshared\fR()
does not refer to an initialized barrier attributes object.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If successful, the
\fIpthread_barrierattr_getpshared\fR()
function shall return zero and store the value of the
.IR process-shared
attribute of
.IR attr
into the object referenced by the
.IR pshared
parameter. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
the error.
.P
If successful, the
\fIpthread_barrierattr_setpshared\fR()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The
\fIpthread_barrierattr_setpshared\fR()
function may fail if:
.TP
.BR EINVAL
The new value specified for the
.IR process-shared
attribute is not one of the legal values PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
or PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.
.P
These functions shall not return an error code of
.BR [EINTR] .
.LP
.IR "The following sections are informative."
.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The
\fIpthread_barrierattr_getpshared\fR()
and
\fIpthread_barrierattr_setpshared\fR()
functions are part of the Thread Process-Shared Synchronization
option and need not be provided on all implementations.
.SH RATIONALE
If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
.IR attr
argument to
\fIpthread_barrierattr_getpshared\fR()
or
\fIpthread_barrierattr_setpshared\fR()
does not refer to an initialized barrier attributes object, it is
recommended that the function should fail and report an
.BR [EINVAL] 
error.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
