Specifies the file descriptor of the socket.
.IP "\fIhow\fR" 12
Specifies the type of shutdown. The values are as follows:
.RS 12 
.IP SHUT_RD 12
Disables further receive operations.
.IP SHUT_WR 12

The
\fIshutdown\fR()
function disables subsequent send and/or receive operations on a
socket, depending on the value of the
