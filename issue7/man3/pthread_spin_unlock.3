.P
int pthread_spin_unlock(pthread_spinlock_t *\fIlock\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\fIpthread_spin_unlock\fR()
function shall release the spin lock referenced by
.IR lock
which was locked via the
\fIpthread_spin_lock\fR()
or
\fIpthread_spin_trylock\fR()
functions.
.P
The results are undefined if the lock is not held by the
calling thread.
.P
If there are threads spinning on the lock when
\fIpthread_spin_unlock\fR()
is called, the lock becomes available and an unspecified spinning
thread shall acquire the lock.
.P
The results are undefined if this function is called with an
uninitialized thread spin lock.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
\fIpthread_spin_unlock\fR()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.

.SH EXAMPLES
None.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
None.
.SH RATIONALE
If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
.IR lock
argument to
\fIpthread_spin_unlock\fR()
does not refer to an initialized spin lock object, it is recommended
that the function should fail and report an
.BR [EINVAL] 
error.
.P
If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
.IR lock
argument to
\fIpthread_spin_unlock\fR()
refers to a spin lock object for which the current thread does not
hold the lock, it is recommended that the function should fail
and report an
.BR [EPERM] 
error.
.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS"
None.
