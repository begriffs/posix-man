void swab(const void *restrict\fP \fIsrc\fP\fB, void *restrict\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIswab\fP() function shall copy \fInbytes\fP bytes, which are
pointed to by \fIsrc\fP, to the object pointed to by
\fIdest\fP, exchanging adjacent bytes. The \fInbytes\fP argument should
be even. If \fInbytes\fP is odd, \fIswab\fP() copies
and exchanges \fInbytes\fP-1 bytes and the disposition of the last
byte is unspecified. If copying takes place between objects
that overlap, the behavior is undefined. If \fInbytes\fP is negative,
\fIswab\fP() does nothing.
