.SH NAME
atof \- convert a string to a double-precision number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdlib.h>
.br
.sp
double atof(const char *\fP\fIstr\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The call \fIatof\fP(\fIstr\fP) shall be equivalent to:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBstrtod(\fP\fIstr\fP\fB,(char **)NULL),
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
except that the handling of errors may differ. If the value cannot
be represented, the behavior is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIatof\fP() function shall return the converted value if the
value can be represented.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIatof\fP() function is subsumed by \fIstrtod\fP() but is retained
because it is
used extensively in existing code. If the number is not known to be
in range, \fIstrtod\fP() should be used because \fIatof\fP() is not
required to perform any error
checking.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
