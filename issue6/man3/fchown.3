.SH NAME
fchown \- change owner and group of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <unistd.h>
.br
.sp
int fchown(int\fP \fIfildes\fP\fB, uid_t\fP \fIowner\fP\fB, gid_t\fP
\fIgroup\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfchown\fP() function shall be equivalent to \fIchown\fP() except
that the file
whose owner and group are changed is specified by the file descriptor
\fIfildes\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIfchown\fP() shall return 0. Otherwise,
it shall return -1 and set \fIerrno\fP to indicate the
error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIfchown\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIfildes\fP argument is not an open file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B EPERM
The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file or the
process does not have appropriate privilege and
_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED indicates that such privilege is required.
.TP 7
.B EROFS
The file referred to by \fIfildes\fP resides on a read-only file system.
.sp
.LP
The \fIfchown\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The owner or group ID is not a value supported by the implementation.
The \fIfildes\fP argument refers to a pipe or socket
\ or an \fIfattach\fP()-ed STREAM and the implementation disallows
execution of \fIfchown\fP() on a pipe.
.TP 7
.B EIO
A physical I/O error has occurred.
.TP 7
.B EINTR
The \fIfchown\fP() function was interrupted by a signal which was
caught.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Changing the Current Owner of a File
.LP
The following example shows how to change the owner of a file named
\fB/home/cnd/mod1\fP to "jones" and the group to
"cnd".
.LP
The numeric value for the user ID is obtained by extracting the user
ID from the user database entry associated with "jones".
Similarly, the numeric value for the group ID is obtained by extracting
the group ID from the group database entry associated with
"cnd". This example assumes the calling program has appropriate privileges.
