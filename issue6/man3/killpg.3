.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIkillpg\fP() function shall send the signal specified by \fIsig\fP
to the process group specified by \fIpgrp\fP.
.LP
If \fIpgrp\fP is greater than 1, \fIkillpg\fP(\fIpgrp\fP,\ \fIsig\fP)
shall be equivalent to
\fIkill\fP(-\fIpgrp\fP,\ \fIsig\fP). If \fIpgrp\fP is less than or
equal to 1, the behavior of \fIkillpg\fP() is
undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
