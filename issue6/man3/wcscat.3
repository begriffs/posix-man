.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwcscat\fP() function shall append a copy of the wide-character
string pointed to by \fIws2\fP (including the
terminating null wide-character code) to the end of the wide-character
string pointed to by \fIws1\fP. The initial wide-character
code of \fIws2\fP shall overwrite the null wide-character code at
the end of \fIws1\fP. If copying takes place between objects
that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwcscat\fP() function shall return \fIws1\fP; no return value
is reserved to indicate an error.
