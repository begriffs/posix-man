.SH NAME
strncat \- concatenate a string with part of another
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <string.h>
.br
.sp
char *strncat(char *restrict\fP \fIs1\fP\fB, const char *restrict\fP
\fIs2\fP\fB, size_t\fP \fIn\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIstrncat\fP() function shall append not more than \fIn\fP bytes
(a null byte and bytes that follow it are not appended)
from the array pointed to by \fIs2\fP to the end of the string pointed
to by \fIs1\fP. The initial byte of \fIs2\fP overwrites
the null byte at the end of \fIs1\fP. A terminating null byte is always
appended to the result. If copying takes place between
objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIstrncat\fP() function shall return \fIs1\fP; no return value
shall be reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
