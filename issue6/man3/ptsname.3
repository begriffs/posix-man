.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB#include <stdlib.h>

.sp
char *ptsname(int\fP \fIfildes\fP\fB); \fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIptsname\fP() function shall return the name of the slave pseudo-terminal
device associated with a master pseudo-terminal
device. The \fIfildes\fP argument is a file descriptor that refers
to the master device. The \fIptsname\fP() function shall
return a pointer to a string containing the pathname of the corresponding
slave device.
.LP
The \fIptsname\fP() function need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIptsname\fP() shall return a pointer
to a string which is the name of the pseudo-terminal slave
device. Upon failure, \fIptsname\fP() shall return a null pointer.
This could occur if \fIfildes\fP is an invalid file descriptor
or if the slave device name does not exist in the file system.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.

\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The value returned may point to a static data area that is overwritten
by each call to \fIptsname\fP().
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
