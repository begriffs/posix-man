.SH NAME
isfinite \- test for finite value
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <math.h>
.br
.sp
int isfinite(real-floating\fP \fIx\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIisfinite\fP() macro shall determine whether its argument has
a finite value (zero, subnormal, or normal, and not
infinite or NaN). First, an argument represented in a format wider
than its semantic type is converted to its semantic type. Then
determination is based on the type of the argument.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIisfinite\fP() macro shall return a non-zero value if and only
if its argument has a finite value.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
