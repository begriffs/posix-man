.SH NAME
posix_memalign \- aligned memory allocation (\fBADVANCED REALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdlib.h>

int posix_memalign(void **\fP\fImemptr\fP\fB, size_t\fP \fIalignment\fP\fB,
size_t\fP \fIsize\fP\fB); \fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIposix_memalign\fP() function shall allocate \fIsize\fP bytes
aligned on a boundary specified by \fIalignment\fP, and
shall return a pointer to the allocated memory in \fImemptr\fP. The
value of \fIalignment\fP shall be a multiple of
\fIsizeof\fP( \fBvoid *\fP), that is also a power of two. Upon successful
completion, the value pointed to by \fImemptr\fP shall
be a multiple of \fIalignment\fP.
.LP
The
\fIfree\fP() function shall deallocate memory that has previously
been allocated by
\fIposix_memalign\fP(). 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIposix_memalign\fP() shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIposix_memalign\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of the alignment parameter is not a power of two multiple
of \fIsizeof\fP( \fBvoid *\fP).
.TP 7
.B ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory available with the requested alignment.
