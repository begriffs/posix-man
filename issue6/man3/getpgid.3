.SH NAME
getpgid \- get the process group ID for a process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <unistd.h>
.br
.sp
pid_t getpgid(pid_t\fP \fIpid\fP\fB); \fP
\fB
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgetpgid\fP() function shall return the process group ID of
the process whose process ID is equal to \fIpid\fP. If
\fIpid\fP is equal to 0, \fIgetpgid\fP() shall return the process
group ID of the calling process.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIgetpgid\fP() shall return a process
group ID. Otherwise, it shall return (\fBpid_t\fP)-1 and
set \fIerrno\fP to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIgetpgid\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EPERM
The process whose process ID is equal to \fIpid\fP is not in the same
session as the calling process, and the implementation
does not allow access to the process group ID of that process from
the calling process.
.TP 7
.B ESRCH
There is no process with a process ID equal to \fIpid\fP.
.sp
.LP
The \fIgetpgid\fP() function may fail if:
