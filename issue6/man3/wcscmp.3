.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwcscmp\fP() function shall compare the wide-character string
pointed to by \fIws1\fP to the wide-character string

The sign of a non-zero return value shall be determined by the sign
of the difference between the values of the first pair of
wide-character codes that differ in the objects being compared.
.SH RETURN VALUE

Upon completion, \fIwcscmp\fP() shall return an integer greater than,
equal to, or less than 0, if the wide-character string
pointed to by \fIws1\fP is greater than, equal to, or less than the
wide-character string pointed to by \fIws2\fP,
respectively.
