.SH NAME
strcasecmp, strncasecmp \- case-insensitive string comparisons
.SH SYNOPSIS

.sp
int strcasecmp(const char *\fP\fIs1\fP\fB, const char *\fP\fIs2\fP\fB);
.br
int strncasecmp(const char *\fP\fIs1\fP\fB, const char *\fP\fIs2\fP\fB,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIstrcasecmp\fP() function shall compare, while ignoring differences
in case, the string pointed to by \fIs1\fP to the
string pointed to by \fIs2\fP. The \fIstrncasecmp\fP() function shall
compare, while ignoring differences in case, not more than
\fIn\fP bytes from the string pointed to by \fIs1\fP to the string
pointed to by \fIs2\fP.
.LP
In the POSIX locale, \fIstrcasecmp\fP() and \fIstrncasecmp\fP() shall
behave as if the strings had been converted to lowercase
and then a byte comparison performed. The results are unspecified
in other locales.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon completion, \fIstrcasecmp\fP() shall return an integer greater
than, equal to, or less than 0, if the string pointed to by
\fIs1\fP is, ignoring case, greater than, equal to, or less than the
string pointed to by \fIs2\fP, respectively.
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIstrncasecmp\fP() shall return an integer
greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the possibly
null-terminated array pointed to by \fIs1\fP is, ignoring case, greater
than, equal to, or less than the possibly null-terminated
array pointed to by \fIs2\fP, respectively.
