.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgetlogin\fP() function shall return a pointer to a string containing
the user name associated by the login activity with
the controlling terminal of the current process. If \fIgetlogin\fP()
returns a non-null pointer, then that pointer points to the
name that the user logged in under, even if there are several login
names with the same user ID.
.LP
The \fIgetlogin\fP() function need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.
.LP
The \fIgetlogin_r\fP() function shall put the name associated by the
login activity with the controlling terminal of the current
process in the character array pointed to by \fIname\fP. The array
is \fInamesize\fP characters long and should have space for
the name and the terminating null character. The maximum size of the
login name is {LOGIN_NAME_MAX}.
.LP
If \fIgetlogin_r\fP() is successful, \fIname\fP points to the name
the user used at login, even if there are several login
names with the same user ID. 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIgetlogin\fP() shall return a pointer
to the login name or a null pointer if the user's login
name cannot be found. Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and
set \fIerrno\fP to indicate the error.
.LP
The return value from \fIgetlogin\fP() may point to static data whose
content is overwritten by each call.
.LP
If successful, the \fIgetlogin_r\fP() function shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIgetlogin\fP() and \fIgetlogin_r\fP() functions may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EMFILE
{OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in the calling process.
.TP 7
.B ENFILE
The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.
.TP 7
.B ENXIO
The calling process has no controlling terminal.
.sp
.LP
The \fIgetlogin_r\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B ERANGE
The value of \fInamesize\fP is smaller than the length of the string
to be returned including the terminating null character.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Getting the User Login Name
.LP
The following example calls the \fIgetlogin\fP() function to obtain
the name of the user associated with the calling process,
and passes this information to the \fIgetpwnam\fP() function to get
the associated user
database information.

.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Three names associated with the current process can be determined:
\fIgetpwuid\fP( \fIgeteuid\fP()) shall return the name associated
with the effective user ID of the process;
\fIgetlogin\fP() shall return the name associated with the current
login activity; and \fIgetpwuid\fP( \fIgetuid\fP()) shall return the
name associated with the real user ID of the process.
.LP
The \fIgetlogin_r\fP() function is thread-safe and returns values
in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a static
data area that may be overwritten by each call.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fIgetlogin\fP() function returns a pointer to the user's login
name. The same user ID may be shared by several login
names. If it is desired to get the user database entry that is used
during login, the result of \fIgetlogin\fP() should be used to
provide the argument to the \fIgetpwnam\fP() function. (This might
be used to determine
the user's login shell, particularly where a single user has multiple
login shells with distinct login names, but the same user
ID.)
.LP
The information provided by the \fIcuserid\fP() function, which was
originally defined in the POSIX.1-1988 standard and
subsequently removed, can be obtained by the following:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBgetpwuid(geteuid())
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
while the information provided by historical implementations of \fIcuserid\fP()
can be obtained by:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBgetpwuid(getuid())
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The thread-safe version of this function places the user name in a
user-supplied buffer and returns a non-zero value if it
fails. The non-thread-safe version may return the name in a static
data area that may be overwritten by each call.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
