.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fItowupper\fP() function has as a domain a type \fBwint_t\fP,
the value of which the application shall ensure is a
character representable as a \fBwchar_t\fP, and a wide-character code
corresponding to a valid character in the current locale or
the value of WEOF. If the argument has any other value, the behavior
is undefined. If the argument of \fItowupper\fP() represents
a lowercase wide-character code, and there exists a corresponding
uppercase wide-character code (as defined by character type
information in the program locale category \fILC_CTYPE ),\fP the result
shall be the corresponding uppercase wide-character code.
All other arguments in the domain are returned unchanged.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fItowupper\fP() shall return the uppercase
letter corresponding to the argument passed. Otherwise,
it shall return the argument unchanged.
