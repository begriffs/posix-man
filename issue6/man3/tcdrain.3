.SH NAME
tcdrain \- wait for transmission of output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <termios.h>
.br
.sp
int tcdrain(int\fP \fIfildes\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fItcdrain\fP() function shall block until all output written
to the object referred to by \fIfildes\fP is transmitted.
The \fIfildes\fP argument is an open file descriptor associated with
a terminal.
.LP
Any attempts to use \fItcdrain\fP() from a process which is a member
of a background process group on a \fIfildes\fP
associated with its controlling terminal, shall cause the process
group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal. If the calling process is
blocking or ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed
to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fItcdrain\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIfildes\fP argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B EINTR
A signal interrupted \fItcdrain\fP().
.TP 7
.B ENOTTY
The file associated with \fIfildes\fP is not a terminal.
.sp
.LP
The \fItcdrain\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EIO
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, and the writing
process is not ignoring or blocking SIGTTOU.
