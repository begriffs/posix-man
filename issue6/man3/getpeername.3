.SH NAME
getpeername \- get the name of the peer socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/socket.h>
.br
.sp
int getpeername(int\fP \fIsocket\fP\fB, struct sockaddr *restrict\fP
\fIaddress\fP\fB,
.br
\ \ \ \ \ \  socklen_t *restrict\fP \fIaddress_len\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgetpeername\fP() function shall retrieve the peer address of
the specified socket, store this address in the
\fBsockaddr\fP structure pointed to by the \fIaddress\fP argument,
and store the length of this address in the object pointed to
by the \fIaddress_len\fP argument.
.LP
If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of
the supplied \fBsockaddr\fP structure, the stored address
shall be truncated.
.LP
If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients, and the peer
is not bound, then the value stored in the object pointed
to by \fIaddress\fP is unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIgetpeername\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIsocket\fP argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The socket has been shut down.
.TP 7
.B ENOTCONN
The socket is not connected or otherwise has not had the peer pre-specified.
.TP 7
.B ENOTSOCK
The \fIsocket\fP argument does not refer to a socket.
.TP 7
.B EOPNOTSUPP
The operation is not supported for the socket protocol.
.sp
.LP
The \fIgetpeername\fP() function may fail if:

.B ENOBUFS
Insufficient resources were available in the system to complete the
call.
