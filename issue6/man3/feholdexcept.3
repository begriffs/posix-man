.SH NAME
feholdexcept \- save current floating-point environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <fenv.h>
.br
.sp
int feholdexcept(fenv_t *\fP\fIenvp\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfeholdexcept\fP() function shall save the current floating-point
environment in the object pointed to by \fIenvp\fP,
clear the floating-point status flags, and then install a non-stop
(continue on floating-point exceptions) mode, if available, for
all floating-point exceptions.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIfeholdexcept\fP() function shall return zero if and only if
non-stop floating-point exception handling was successfully
installed.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fIfeholdexcept\fP() function should be effective on typical IEC\ 60559:1989
standard implementations which have the
default non-stop mode and at least one other mode for trap handling
or aborting. If the implementation provides only the non-stop
mode, then installing the non-stop mode is trivial.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
