int isnormal(real-floating\fP \fIx\fP\fB);

\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIisnormal\fP() macro shall determine whether its argument value
is normal (neither zero, subnormal, infinite, nor NaN).
First, an argument represented in a format wider than its semantic
type is converted to its semantic type. Then determination is
based on the type of the argument.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIisnormal\fP() macro shall return a non-zero value if and only
if its argument has a normal value.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
