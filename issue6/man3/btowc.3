.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIbtowc\fP() function shall determine whether \fIc\fP constitutes
a valid (one-byte) character in the initial shift
state.
.LP
The behavior of this function shall be affected by the \fILC_CTYPE\fP
category of the current locale.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIbtowc\fP() function shall return WEOF if \fIc\fP has the value
EOF or if \fB(unsigned char)\fP \fIc\fP does not
constitute a valid (one-byte) character in the initial shift state.
Otherwise, it shall return the wide-character representation of
that character.
