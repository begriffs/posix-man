.SH NAME
wmemchr \- find a wide character in memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <wchar.h>
.br
.sp
wchar_t *wmemchr(const wchar_t *\fP\fIws\fP\fB, wchar_t\fP \fIwc\fP\fB,
size_t\fP \fIn\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwmemchr\fP() function shall locate the first occurrence of
\fIwc\fP in the initial \fIn\fP wide characters of the
object pointed to by \fIws\fP. This function shall not be affected
by locale and all \fBwchar_t\fP values shall be treated
identically. The null wide character and \fBwchar_t\fP values not
corresponding to valid characters shall not be treated
specially.
.LP
If \fIn\fP is zero, the application shall ensure that \fIws\fP is
a valid pointer and the function behaves as if no valid
occurrence of \fIwc\fP is found.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwmemchr\fP() function shall return a pointer to the located
wide character, or a null pointer if the wide character does
not occur in the object.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
