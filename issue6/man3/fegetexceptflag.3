.SH NAME
fegetexceptflag, fesetexceptflag \- get and set floating-point status
flags
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <fenv.h>
.br
.sp
int fegetexceptflag(fexcept_t *\fP\fIflagp\fP\fB, int\fP \fIexcepts\fP\fB);
.br
int fesetexceptflag(const fexcept_t *\fP\fIflagp\fP\fB, int\fP \fIexcepts\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfegetexceptflag\fP() function shall attempt to store an implementation-defined
representation of the states of the
floating-point status flags indicated by the argument \fIexcepts\fP
in the object pointed to by the argument \fIflagp\fP.
.LP
The \fIfesetexceptflag\fP() function shall attempt to set the floating-point
status flags indicated by the argument
\fIexcepts\fP to the states stored in the object pointed to by \fIflagp\fP.
The value pointed to by \fIflagp\fP shall have been
set by a previous call to \fIfegetexceptflag\fP() whose second argument
represented at least those floating-point exceptions
represented by the argument \fIexcepts\fP. This function does not
raise floating-point exceptions, but only sets the state of the
flags.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
If the representation was successfully stored, \fIfegetexceptflag\fP()
shall return zero. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero
value. If the \fIexcepts\fP argument is zero or if all the specified
exceptions were successfully set, \fIfesetexceptflag\fP()
shall return zero. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value.
