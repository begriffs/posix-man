.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIpthread_attr_getscope\fP() and \fIpthread_attr_setscope\fP()
functions, respectively, shall get and set the
\fIcontentionscope\fP attribute in the \fIattr\fP object.
.LP
The \fIcontentionscope\fP attribute may have the values PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM,
signifying system scheduling contention scope, or
PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS, signifying process scheduling contention scope.
The symbols PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM and PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS
are defined in the \fI<pthread.h>\fP header.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
If successful, the \fIpthread_attr_getscope\fP() and \fIpthread_attr_setscope\fP()
functions shall return zero; otherwise, an
error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIpthread_attr_setscope\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of \fIcontentionscope\fP is not valid.
.TP 7
.B ENOTSUP
An attempt was made to set the attribute to an unsupported value.
.sp
.LP
These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

routines does not affect the current running
thread.
.SH RATIONALE
