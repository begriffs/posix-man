.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgrantpt\fP() function shall change the mode and ownership of
the slave pseudo-terminal device associated with its master
pseudo-terminal counterpart. The \fIfildes\fP argument is a file descriptor
that refers to a master pseudo-terminal device. The
user ID of the slave shall be set to the real UID of the calling process
and the group ID shall be set to an unspecified group ID.
The permission mode of the slave pseudo-terminal shall be set to readable
and writable by the owner, and writable by the group.
.LP
The behavior of the \fIgrantpt\fP() function is unspecified if the
application has installed a signal handler to catch SIGCHLD
signals.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIgrantpt\fP() shall return 0; otherwise,
it shall return -1 and set \fIerrno\fP to indicate the
error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIgrantpt\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIfildes\fP argument is not a valid open file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIfildes\fP argument is not associated with a master pseudo-terminal
device.
.TP 7
.B EACCES
The corresponding slave pseudo-terminal device could not be accessed.
