.SH NAME
wctrans \- define character mapping
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <wctype.h>
.br
.sp
wctrans_t wctrans(const char *\fP\fIcharclass\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwctrans\fP() function is defined for valid character mapping
names identified in the current locale. The
\fIcharclass\fP is a string identifying a generic character mapping
name for which codeset-specific information is required. The
following character mapping names are defined in all locales: \fBtolower\fP
and \fBtoupper\fP.
.LP
The function shall return a value of type \fBwctrans_t\fP, which can
be used as the second argument to subsequent calls of \fItowctrans\fP().
The \fIwctrans\fP() function shall determine values of \fBwctrans_t\fP
according to the rules of the coded character set defined by character
mapping information in the program's locale (category
\fILC_CTYPE ).\fP The values returned by \fIwctrans\fP() shall be
valid until a call to \fIsetlocale\fP() that modifies the category
\fILC_CTYPE\fP. 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwctrans\fP() function shall return 0  and may set \fIerrno\fP
to indicate the error if the given character mapping name is not
valid for the current
locale (category \fILC_CTYPE );\fP otherwise, it shall return a non-zero
object of type \fBwctrans_t\fP that can be used in calls
to \fItowctrans\fP().
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIwctrans\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The character mapping name pointed to by \fIcharclass\fP is not valid
in the current locale.
