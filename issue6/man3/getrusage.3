.SH NAME
getrusage \- get information about resource utilization
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/resource.h>
.br
.sp
int getrusage(int\fP \fIwho\fP\fB, struct rusage *\fP\fIr_usage\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgetrusage\fP() function shall provide measures of the resources
used by the current process or its terminated and
waited-for child processes. If the value of the \fIwho\fP argument
is RUSAGE_SELF, information shall be returned about resources
used by the current process. If the value of the \fIwho\fP argument
is RUSAGE_CHILDREN, information shall be returned about
resources used by the terminated and waited-for children of the current
process. If the child is never waited for (for example, if
the parent has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or sets SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN), the resource
information for the child process is discarded and not
included in the resource information provided by \fIgetrusage\fP().
.LP
The \fIr_usage\fP argument is a pointer to an object of type \fBstruct
rusage\fP in which the returned information is
stored.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIgetrusage\fP() shall return 0; otherwise,
-1 shall be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate
the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIgetrusage\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of the \fIwho\fP argument is not valid.
