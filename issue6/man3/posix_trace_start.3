.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIposix_trace_start\fP() and \fIposix_trace_stop\fP() functions,
respectively, shall start and stop the trace stream
identified by the argument \fItrid\fP.
.LP
The effect of calling the \fIposix_trace_start\fP() function shall
be recorded in the trace stream as the POSIX_TRACE_START
system trace event and the status of the trace stream shall become
POSIX_TRACE_RUNNING. If the trace stream is in progress when
this function is called, the POSIX_TRACE_START system trace event
shall not be recorded and the trace stream shall continue to run.
If the trace stream is full, the POSIX_TRACE_START system trace event
shall not be recorded and the status of the trace stream
shall not be changed.
.LP
The effect of calling the \fIposix_trace_stop\fP() function shall
be recorded in the trace stream as the POSIX_TRACE_STOP
system trace event and the status of the trace stream shall become
POSIX_TRACE_SUSPENDED. If the trace stream is suspended when
this function is called, the POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event shall
not be recorded and the trace stream shall remain suspended.
If the trace stream is full, the POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event
shall not be recorded and the status of the trace stream shall
not be changed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value of
zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error
number.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of the argument \fItrid\fP does not correspond to an active
trace stream and thus no trace stream was started or
stopped.
.TP 7
.B EINTR
The operation was interrupted by a signal and thus the trace stream
was not necessarily started or stopped.
