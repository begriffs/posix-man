.SH NAME
fileno \- map a stream pointer to a file descriptor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
int fileno(FILE *\fP\fIstream\fP\fB); \fP
\fB
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfileno\fP() function shall return the integer file descriptor
associated with the stream pointed to by
\fIstream\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIfileno\fP() shall return the integer
value of the file descriptor associated with \fIstream\fP.
Otherwise, the value -1 shall be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate
the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIfileno\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIstream\fP argument is not a valid stream.

\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Without some specification of which file descriptors are associated
with these streams, it is impossible for an application to
set up the streams for another application it starts with \fIfork\fP()
and \fIexec\fP. In particular, it would not be possible to write a
portable version of the \fIsh\fP command interpreter (although there
may be other constraints that would prevent that
portability).
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
