.SH NAME
strrchr \- string scanning operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <string.h>
.br
.sp
char *strrchr(const char *\fP\fIs\fP\fB, int\fP \fIc\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIstrrchr\fP() function shall locate the last occurrence of \fIc\fP
(converted to a \fBchar\fP) in the string pointed to
by \fIs\fP. The terminating null byte is considered to be part of
the string.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIstrrchr\fP() shall return a pointer
to the byte or a null pointer if \fIc\fP does not occur in
the string.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Finding the Base Name of a File
.LP
The following example uses \fIstrrchr\fP() to get a pointer to the
base name of a file. The \fIstrrchr\fP() function searches
backwards through the name of the file to find the last \fB'/'\fP
character in \fIname\fP. This pointer (plus one) will point
to the base name of the file.
