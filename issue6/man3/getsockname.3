.SH NAME
getsockname \- get the socket name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/socket.h>
.br
.sp
int getsockname(int\fP \fIsocket\fP\fB, struct sockaddr *restrict\fP
\fIaddress\fP\fB,
.br
\ \ \ \ \ \  socklen_t *restrict\fP \fIaddress_len\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgetsockname\fP() function shall retrieve the locally-bound
name of the specified socket, store this address in the
\fBsockaddr\fP structure pointed to by the \fIaddress\fP argument,
and store the length of this address in the object pointed to
by the \fIaddress_len\fP argument.
.LP
If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of
the supplied \fBsockaddr\fP structure, the stored address
shall be truncated.
.LP
If the socket has not been bound to a local name, the value stored
in the object pointed to by \fIaddress\fP is
unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned, the \fIaddress\fP
argument shall point to the address of the socket, and the
\fIaddress_len\fP argument shall point to the length of the address.
Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIgetsockname\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIsocket\fP argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B ENOTSOCK
The \fIsocket\fP argument does not refer to a socket.
.TP 7
.B EOPNOTSUPP
The operation is not supported for this socket's protocol.
.sp
.LP
The \fIgetsockname\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The socket has been shut down.
.TP 7
.B ENOBUFS
Insufficient resources were available in the system to complete the
function.
