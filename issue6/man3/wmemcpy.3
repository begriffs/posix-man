wchar_t *wmemcpy(wchar_t *restrict\fP \fIws1\fP\fB, const wchar_t
*restrict\fP \fIws2\fP\fB,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwmemcpy\fP() function shall copy \fIn\fP wide characters from
the object pointed to by \fIws2\fP to the object pointed
to by \fIws1\fP. This function shall not be affected by locale and
all \fBwchar_t\fP values shall be treated identically. The
null wide character and \fBwchar_t\fP values not corresponding to
valid characters shall not be treated specially.
.LP
If \fIn\fP is zero, the application shall ensure that \fIws1\fP and
\fIws2\fP are valid pointers, and the function shall copy
zero wide characters.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwmemcpy\fP() function shall return the value of \fIws1\fP.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
