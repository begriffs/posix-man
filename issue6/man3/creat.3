The following example creates the file \fB/tmp/file\fP with read and
write permissions for the file owner and read permission
for group and others. The resulting file descriptor is assigned to
the \fIfd\fP variable.

.nf

\fB#include <fcntl.h>

int fd;
mode_t mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH;
char *filename = "/tmp/file";

.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fIcreat\fP() function is redundant. Its services are also provided
by the \fIopen\fP() function. It has been included primarily for historical
purposes since many existing
applications depend on it. It is best considered a part of the C binding
rather than a function that should be provided in other
languages.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
