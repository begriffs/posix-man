.SH NAME
getsid \- get the process group ID of a session leader
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <unistd.h>
.br
.sp
pid_t getsid(pid_t\fP \fIpid\fP\fB); \fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgetsid\fP() function shall obtain the process group ID of the
process that is the session leader of the process
specified by \fIpid\fP. If \fIpid\fP is (\fBpid_t\fP)0, it specifies
the calling process.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIgetsid\fP() shall return the process
group ID of the session leader of the specified process.
Otherwise, it shall return (\fBpid_t\fP)-1 and set \fIerrno\fP to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIgetsid\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EPERM
The process specified by \fIpid\fP is not in the same session as the
calling process, and the implementation does not allow
access to the process group ID of the session leader of that process
from the calling process.
.TP 7
.B ESRCH
There is no process with a process ID equal to \fIpid\fP.
