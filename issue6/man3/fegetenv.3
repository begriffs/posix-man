.SH NAME
fegetenv, fesetenv \- get and set current floating-point environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <fenv.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfegetenv\fP() function shall attempt to store the current floating-point
environment in the object pointed to by
\fIenvp\fP.
.LP
The \fIfesetenv\fP() function shall attempt to establish the floating-point
environment represented by the object pointed to by
\fIenvp\fP. The argument \fIenvp\fP shall point to an object set by
a call to \fIfegetenv\fP() or \fIfeholdexcept\fP(), or equal a floating-point
environment macro. The \fIfesetenv\fP()
function does not raise floating-point exceptions, but only installs
the state of the floating-point status flags represented
through its argument.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
If the representation was successfully stored, \fIfegetenv\fP() shall
return zero. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value.
If the environment was successfully established, \fIfesetenv\fP()
shall return zero. Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero
value.
