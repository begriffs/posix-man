.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBrewind(stream)
\fP

Since \fIrewind\fP() does not return a value, an application wishing
to detect errors should clear \fIerrno\fP, then call
\fIrewind\fP(), and if \fIerrno\fP is non-zero, assume an error has
occurred.

.LP
The \fIrewind\fP() function shall not return a value.
.SH ERRORS

Refer to \fIfseek\fP() with the exception of [EINVAL] which does not
