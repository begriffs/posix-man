.SH NAME
sched_getscheduler \- get scheduling policy (\fBREALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sched.h>
.br
.sp
int sched_getscheduler(pid_t\fP \fIpid\fP\fB); \fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIsched_getscheduler\fP() function shall return the scheduling
policy of the process specified by \fIpid\fP. If the value
of \fIpid\fP is negative, the behavior of the \fIsched_getscheduler\fP()
function is unspecified.
.LP
The values that can be returned by \fIsched_getscheduler\fP() are
defined in the \fI<sched.h>\fP header.
.LP
If a process specified by \fIpid\fP exists, and if the calling process
has permission, the scheduling policy shall be returned
for the process whose process ID is equal to \fIpid\fP.
.LP
If \fIpid\fP is zero, the scheduling policy shall be returned for
the calling process.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIsched_getscheduler\fP() function
shall return the scheduling policy of the specified
process. If unsuccessful, the function shall return -1 and set \fIerrno\fP
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIsched_getscheduler\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EPERM
The requesting process does not have permission to determine the scheduling
policy of the specified process.
.TP 7
.B ESRCH
No process can be found corresponding to that specified by \fIpid\fP.
