.SH NAME
access \- determine accessibility of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <unistd.h>
.br
.sp
int access(const char *\fP\fIpath\fP\fB, int\fP \fIamode\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIaccess\fP() function shall check the file named by the pathname
pointed to by the \fIpath\fP argument for accessibility
according to the bit pattern contained in \fIamode\fP, using the real
user ID in place of the effective user ID and the real group
ID in place of the effective group ID.
.LP
The value of \fIamode\fP is either the bitwise-inclusive OR of the
access permissions to be checked (R_OK, W_OK, X_OK) or the
existence test (F_OK).
.LP
If any access permissions are checked, each shall be checked individually,
as described in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Chapter 3, Definitions. If the process has
appropriate
privileges, an implementation may indicate success for X_OK even if
none of the execute file permission bits are set.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
If the requested access is permitted, \fIaccess\fP() succeeds and
shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and
\fIerrno\fP shall be set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIaccess\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EACCES
Permission bits of the file mode do not permit the requested access,
or search permission is denied on a component of the path
prefix.
.TP 7
.B ELOOP
A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the
\fIpath\fP argument.
.TP 7
.B ENAMETOOLONG
The length of the \fIpath\fP argument exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname
component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.
.TP 7
.B ENOENT
A component of \fIpath\fP does not name an existing file or \fIpath\fP
is an empty string.
.TP 7
.B ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.TP 7
.B EROFS
Write access is requested for a file on a read-only file system.
.sp
.LP
The \fIaccess\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of the \fIamode\fP argument is invalid.
.TP 7
.B ELOOP
More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution
of the \fIpath\fP argument.
.TP 7
.B ENAMETOOLONG
As a result of encountering a symbolic link in resolution of the \fIpath\fP
argument, the length of the substituted pathname
string exceeded {PATH_MAX}.
.TP 7
.B ETXTBSY
Write access is requested for a pure procedure (shared text) file
that is being executed.
.sp
.LP

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Testing for the Existence of a File
.LP
The following example tests whether a file named \fBmyfile\fP exists
in the \fB/tmp\fP directory.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB#include <unistd.h>
\&...
int result;
const char *filename = "/tmp/myfile";
.sp

result = access (filename, F_OK);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Additional values of \fIamode\fP other than the set defined in the
description may be valid; for example, if a system has
extended access controls.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
In early proposals, some inadequacies in the \fIaccess\fP() function
led to the creation of an \fIeaccess\fP() function
because:
.IP " 1." 4
Historical implementations of \fIaccess\fP() do not test file access
correctly when the process' real user ID is superuser. In
particular, they always return zero when testing execute permissions
without regard to whether the file is executable.
.LP
.IP " 2." 4
The superuser has complete access to all files on a system. As a consequence,
programs started by the superuser and switched to
the effective user ID with lesser privileges cannot use \fIaccess\fP()
to test their file access permissions.
.LP
.LP
However, the historical model of \fIeaccess\fP() does not resolve
problem (1), so this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001
now allows \fIaccess\fP() to behave in the desired way because several
implementations have corrected the problem. It was also
argued that problem (2) is more easily solved by using \fIopen\fP(),
\fIchdir\fP(), or one of the \fIexec\fP functions as
appropriate and responding to the error, rather than creating a new
function that would not be as reliable. Therefore,
\fIeaccess\fP() is not included in this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001.
.LP
The sentence concerning appropriate privileges and execute permission
bits reflects the two possibilities implemented by
historical implementations when checking superuser access for X_OK.
.LP
New implementations are discouraged from returning X_OK unless at
least one execution permission bit is set.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
