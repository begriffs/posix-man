.SH NAME
strncpy \- copy part of a string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <string.h>
.br
.sp
char *strncpy(char *restrict\fP \fIs1\fP\fB, const char *restrict\fP
\fIs2\fP\fB, size_t\fP \fIn\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIstrncpy\fP() function shall copy not more than \fIn\fP bytes
(bytes that follow a null byte are not copied) from the
array pointed to by \fIs2\fP to the array pointed to by \fIs1\fP.
If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
behavior is undefined.
.LP
If the array pointed to by \fIs2\fP is a string that is shorter than
\fIn\fP bytes, null bytes shall be appended to the copy
in the array pointed to by \fIs1\fP, until \fIn\fP bytes in all are
written.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIstrncpy\fP() function shall return \fIs1\fP; no return value
is reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Character movement is performed differently in different implementations.
Thus, overlapping moves may yield surprises.
.LP
If there is no null byte in the first \fIn\fP bytes of the array pointed
to by \fIs2\fP, the result is not
null-terminated.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
