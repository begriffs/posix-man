.SH NAME
fputs \- put a string on a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
int fputs(const char *restrict\fP \fIs\fP\fB, FILE *restrict\fP \fIstream\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfputs\fP() function shall write the null-terminated string
pointed to by \fIs\fP to the stream pointed to by
\fIstream\fP. The terminating null byte shall not be written.
.LP
The
\fIst_ctime\fP and \fIst_mtime\fP fields of the file shall be marked
for update between the successful execution of
\fIfputs\fP() and the next successful completion of a call to \fIfflush\fP()
or \fIfclose\fP() on the same stream or a call to \fIexit\fP()
or \fIabort\fP(). 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIfputs\fP() shall return a non-negative
number. Otherwise, it shall return EOF, set an error
indicator for the stream,  and set \fIerrno\fP to indicate the
error. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
Refer to \fIfputc\fP().
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Printing to Standard Output
.LP
The following example gets the current time, converts it to a string
using \fIlocaltime\fP() and \fIasctime\fP(), and prints it to
standard output using \fIfputs\fP(). It then prints the number of
minutes to an event for which it is waiting.
