.SH NAME
tcflow \- suspend or restart the transmission or reception of data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <termios.h>

.sp
int tcflow(int\fP \fIfildes\fP\fB, int\fP \fIaction\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fItcflow\fP() function shall suspend or restart transmission
or reception of data on the object referred to by
\fIfildes\fP, depending on the value of \fIaction\fP. The \fIfildes\fP
argument is an open file descriptor associated with a
terminal.
.IP " *" 3
If \fIaction\fP is TCOOFF, output shall be suspended.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
If \fIaction\fP is TCOON, suspended output shall be restarted.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
If \fIaction\fP is TCIOFF, the system shall transmit a STOP character,
which is intended to cause the terminal device to stop
transmitting data to the system.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
If \fIaction\fP is TCION, the system shall transmit a START character,
which is intended to cause the terminal device to start
transmitting data to the system.
.LP
.LP
The default on the opening of a terminal file is that neither its
input nor its output are suspended.
.LP
Attempts to use \fItcflow\fP() from a process which is a member of
a background process group on a \fIfildes\fP associated
with its controlling terminal, shall cause the process group to be
sent a SIGTTOU signal. If the calling process is blocking or
ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform
the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fItcflow\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIfildes\fP argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIaction\fP argument is not a supported value.
.TP 7
.B ENOTTY
The file associated with \fIfildes\fP is not a terminal.
.sp
.LP
The \fItcflow\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EIO
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, and the writing
process is not ignoring or blocking SIGTTOU.
