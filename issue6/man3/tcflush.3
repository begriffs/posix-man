.SH NAME
tcflush \- flush non-transmitted output data, non-read input data,
or both
.SH SYNOPSIS

int tcflush(int\fP \fIfildes\fP\fB, int\fP \fIqueue_selector\fP\fB);

\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fItcflush\fP() shall discard data written
to the object referred to by \fIfildes\fP (an open file
descriptor associated with a terminal) but not transmitted, or data
received but not read, depending on the value of
\fIqueue_selector\fP:
.IP " *" 3
If \fIqueue_selector\fP is TCIFLUSH, it shall flush data received
but not read.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
If \fIqueue_selector\fP is TCOFLUSH, it shall flush data written but
not transmitted.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
If \fIqueue_selector\fP is TCIOFLUSH, it shall flush both data received
but not read and data written but not transmitted.
.LP
.LP
Attempts to use \fItcflush\fP() from a process which is a member of
a background process group on a \fIfildes\fP associated
with its controlling terminal shall cause the process group to be
sent a SIGTTOU signal. If the calling process is blocking or
ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform
the operation, and no signal is sent.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fItcflush\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIfildes\fP argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIqueue_selector\fP argument is not a supported value.
.TP 7
.B ENOTTY
The file associated with \fIfildes\fP is not a terminal.
.sp
.LP
The \fItcflush\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EIO
The process group of the writing process is orphaned, and the writing
process is not ignoring or blocking SIGTTOU.
