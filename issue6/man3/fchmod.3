.SH NAME
fchmod \- change mode of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/stat.h>
.br
.sp
int fchmod(int\fP \fIfildes\fP\fB, mode_t\fP \fImode\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfchmod\fP() function shall be equivalent to \fIchmod\fP() except
that the file
whose permissions are changed is specified by the file descriptor
\fIfildes\fP.
.LP
If \fIfildes\fP references a shared memory object, the \fIfchmod\fP()
function need only affect the S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP,
S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH file permission bits. 
.LP
If \fIfildes\fP references a typed memory object, the behavior of
\fIfchmod\fP() is unspecified. 
.LP
If \fIfildes\fP refers to a socket, the behavior of \fIfchmod\fP()
is unspecified.
.LP
If \fIfildes\fP refers to a STREAM (which is \fIfattach\fP()-ed into
the file system name
space) the call returns successfully, doing nothing. 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIfchmod\fP() shall return 0. Otherwise,
it shall return -1 and set \fIerrno\fP to indicate the
error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIfchmod\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIfildes\fP argument is not an open file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B EPERM
The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file and the
process does not have appropriate privilege.
.TP 7
.B EROFS
The file referred to by \fIfildes\fP resides on a read-only file system.
.sp
.LP
The \fIfchmod\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINTR
The \fIfchmod\fP() function was interrupted by a signal. 
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of the \fImode\fP argument is invalid. 
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIfildes\fP argument refers to a pipe and the implementation
disallows execution of \fIfchmod\fP() on a pipe.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Changing the Current Permissions for a File
.LP
The following example shows how to change the permissions for a file
named \fB/home/cnd/mod1\fP so that the owner and group
have read/write/execute permissions, but the world only has read/write
permissions.
