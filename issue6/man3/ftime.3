.SH NAME
ftime \- get date and time (\fBLEGACY\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/timeb.h>
.br
.sp
int ftime(struct timeb *\fP\fItp\fP\fB); \fP
\fB

\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIftime\fP() function shall set the \fItime\fP and \fImillitm\fP
members of the \fBtimeb\fP structure pointed to by
\fItp\fP to contain the seconds and milliseconds portions, respectively,
of the current time in seconds since the Epoch. The
contents of the \fItimezone\fP and \fIdstflag\fP members of \fItp\fP
after a call to \fIftime\fP() are unspecified.
.LP
The system clock need not have millisecond granularity. Depending
on any granularity (particularly a granularity of one) renders
code non-portable.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIftime\fP() function shall return
0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Getting the Current Time and Date
.LP
The following example shows how to get the current system time values
using the \fIftime\fP() function. The \fBtimeb\fP
structure pointed to by \fItp\fP is filled with the current system
time values for \fItime\fP and \fImillitm\fP.

int          status;
\&...
status = ftime(&tp);

.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
For applications portability, the \fItime\fP() function should be
used to determine the
current time instead of \fIftime\fP(). Realtime applications should
use \fIclock_gettime\fP() to determine the current time instead of
\fIftime\fP().
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
This function may be withdrawn in a future version.
