.SH NAME
fegetround, fesetround \- get and set current rounding direction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <fenv.h>
.br
.sp
int fegetround(void);
.br
int fesetround(int\fP \fIround\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfegetround\fP() function shall get the current rounding direction.
.LP
The \fIfesetround\fP() function shall establish the rounding direction
represented by its argument \fIround\fP. If the
argument is not equal to the value of a rounding direction macro,
the rounding direction is not changed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIfegetround\fP() function shall return the value of the rounding
direction macro representing the current rounding
direction or a negative value if there is no such rounding direction
macro or the current rounding direction is not
determinable.
.LP
The \fIfesetround\fP() function shall return a zero value if and only
if the requested rounding direction was established.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The following example saves, sets, and restores the rounding direction,
reporting an error and aborting if setting the rounding
direction fails:

.RS
.nf

\fB#include <fenv.h>
#include <assert.h>
void f(int round_dir)
{
    #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
    int save_round;
    int setround_ok;
    save_round = fegetround();
    setround_ok = fesetround(round_dir);
    assert(setround_ok == 0);
    /* ... */
    fesetround(save_round);
    /* ... */
