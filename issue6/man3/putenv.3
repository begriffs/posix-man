.SH NAME
putenv \- change or add a value to an environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdlib.h>
.br
.sp
int putenv(char *\fP\fIstring\fP\fB); \fP
\fB
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIputenv\fP() function shall use the \fIstring\fP argument to
set environment variable values. The \fIstring\fP argument
should point to a string of the form " \fIname\fP= \fIvalue\fP ".
The \fIputenv\fP() function shall make the value of the
environment variable \fIname\fP equal to \fIvalue\fP by altering an
existing variable or creating a new one. In either case, the
string pointed to by \fIstring\fP shall become part of the environment,
so altering the string shall change the environment. The
space used by \fIstring\fP is no longer used once a new string which
defines \fIname\fP is passed to \fIputenv\fP().
.LP
The \fIputenv\fP() function need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIputenv\fP() shall return 0; otherwise,
it shall return a non-zero value and set \fIerrno\fP to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIputenv\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient memory was available.
.sp
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Changing the Value of an Environment Variable
.LP
The following example changes the value of the \fIHOME\fP environment
variable to the value \fB/usr/home\fP.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB#include <stdlib.h>
\&...
static char *var = "HOME=/usr/home";
int ret;
.sp

ret = putenv(var);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIputenv\fP() function manipulates the environment pointed to
by \fIenviron\fP, and can be used in conjunction with \fIgetenv\fP().
.LP
See \fIexec\fP(), for restrictions on changing the environment in
multi-threaded applications.
.LP
This routine may use \fImalloc\fP() to enlarge the environment.
.LP
A potential error is to call \fIputenv\fP() with an automatic variable
as the argument, then return from the calling function
while \fIstring\fP is still part of the environment.
.LP
The \fIsetenv\fP() function is preferred over this function.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The standard developers noted that \fIputenv\fP() is the only function
available to add to the environment without permitting
memory leaks.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
