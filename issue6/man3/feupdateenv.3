.SH NAME
feupdateenv \- update floating-point environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <fenv.h>
.br
.sp
int feupdateenv(const fenv_t *\fP\fIenvp\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfeupdateenv\fP() function shall attempt to save the currently
raised floating-point exceptions in its automatic storage,
attempt to install the floating-point environment represented by the
object pointed to by \fIenvp\fP, and then attempt to raise
the saved floating-point exceptions. The argument \fIenvp\fP shall
point to an object set by a call to \fIfeholdexcept\fP() or \fIfegetenv\fP(),
or equal
a floating-point environment macro.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIfeupdateenv\fP() function shall return a zero value if and
only if all the required actions were successfully carried
out.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The following example shows sample code to hide spurious underflow
floating-point exceptions:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB#include <fenv.h>
double f(double x)
{
    #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
    double result;
    fenv_t save_env;
    feholdexcept(&save_env);
    // compute result
    if (/* test spurious underflow */)
    feclearexcept(FE_UNDERFLOW);
    feupdateenv(&save_env);
    return result;
