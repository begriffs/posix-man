.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwcwidth\fP() function shall determine the number of column
positions required for the wide character \fIwc\fP. The
application shall ensure that the value of \fIwc\fP is a character
representable as a \fBwchar_t\fP, and is a wide-character code
corresponding to a valid character in the current locale.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwcwidth\fP() function shall either return 0 (if \fIwc\fP is
a null wide-character code), or return the number of column
positions to be occupied by the wide-character code \fIwc\fP, or return
-1 (if \fIwc\fP does not correspond to a printable
wide-character code).
