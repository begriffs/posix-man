.SH NAME
towctrans \- wide-character transliteration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <wctype.h>
.br
.sp
wint_t towctrans(wint_t\fP \fIwc\fP\fB, wctrans_t\fP \fIdesc\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fItowctrans\fP() function shall transliterate the wide-character
code \fIwc\fP using the mapping described by
\fIdesc\fP. The current setting of the \fILC_CTYPE\fP category should
be the same as during the call to \fIwctrans\fP() that returned the
value \fIdesc\fP.  If the value
of \fIdesc\fP is invalid (that is, not obtained by a call to \fIwctrans\fP()
or
\fIdesc\fP is invalidated by a subsequent call to \fIsetlocale\fP()
that has affected
category \fILC_CTYPE ),\fP the result is unspecified.
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to 0 before calling \fItowctrans\fP(). If
\fIerrno\fP is non-zero on return, an error has occurred. 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
If successful, the \fItowctrans\fP() function shall return the mapped
value of \fIwc\fP using the mapping described by
\fIdesc\fP. Otherwise, it shall return \fIwc\fP unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fItowctrans\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
\fIdesc\fP contains an invalid transliteration descriptor.
