.SH NAME
sem_unlink \- remove a named semaphore (\fBREALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <semaphore.h>
.br
.sp
int sem_unlink(const char *\fP\fIname\fP\fB); \fP

\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIsem_unlink\fP() function shall remove the semaphore named by
the string \fIname\fP. If the semaphore named by
\fIname\fP is currently referenced by other processes, then \fIsem_unlink\fP()
shall have no effect on the state of the
semaphore. If one or more processes have the semaphore open when \fIsem_unlink\fP()
is called, destruction of the semaphore is
postponed until all references to the semaphore have been destroyed
by calls to \fIsem_close\fP(), \fI_exit\fP(), or \fIexec\fP. Calls
to \fIsem_open\fP() to recreate or reconnect
to the semaphore refer to a new semaphore after \fIsem_unlink\fP()
is called. The \fIsem_unlink\fP() call shall not block until
all references have been destroyed; it shall return immediately.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIsem_unlink\fP() function shall
return a value of 0. Otherwise, the semaphore shall not be
changed and the function shall return a value of -1 and set \fIerrno\fP
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIsem_unlink\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EACCES
Permission is denied to unlink the named semaphore.
.TP 7
.B ENAMETOOLONG
The length of the \fIname\fP argument exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname
component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.
.TP 7
.B ENOENT
The named semaphore does not exist.
.sp

\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIsem_unlink\fP() function is part of the Semaphores option and
need not be available on all implementations.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
