.SH NAME
cfsetispeed \- set input baud rate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <termios.h>
.br
.sp
int cfsetispeed(struct termios *\fP\fItermios_p\fP\fB, speed_t\fP
\fIspeed\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIcfsetispeed\fP() function shall set the input baud rate stored
in the structure pointed to by \fItermios_p\fP to
\fIspeed.\fP
.LP
There shall be no effect on the baud rates set in the hardware until
a subsequent successful call to \fItcsetattr\fP() with the same \fBtermios\fP
structure. Similarly, errors resulting from
attempts to set baud rates not supported by the terminal device need
not be detected until the \fItcsetattr\fP() function is called.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIcfsetispeed\fP() shall return 0; otherwise,
-1 shall be returned, and \fIerrno\fP may be set to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIcfsetispeed\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIspeed\fP value is not a valid baud rate.
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of \fIspeed\fP is outside the range of possible speed values
as specified in \fI<termios.h>\fP.
