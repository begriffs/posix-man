.SH NAME
mktemp \- make a unique filename (\fBLEGACY\fP)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fImktemp\fP() function shall replace the contents of the string
pointed to by \fItemplate\fP by a unique filename and
return \fItemplate\fP. The application shall initialize \fItemplate\fP
to be a filename with six trailing \fB'X'\fP s;
\fImktemp\fP() shall replace each \fB'X'\fP with a single byte character
from the portable filename character set.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fImktemp\fP() function shall return the pointer \fItemplate\fP.
If a unique name cannot be created, \fItemplate\fP shall
point to a null string.
.SH ERRORS

No errors are defined.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Generating a Filename
.LP

string with a 10-character filename beginning with the
characters \fB"file"\fP and returns a pointer to the \fB"template"\fP
string that contains the new filename.

.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Between the time a pathname is created and the file opened, it is
possible for some other process to create a file with the same
name. The \fImkstemp\fP() function avoids this problem and is preferred
over this
function.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
This function may be withdrawn in a future version.
