.SH NAME
strcoll \- string comparison using collating information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <string.h>
.br
.sp
int strcoll(const char *\fP\fIs1\fP\fB, const char *\fP\fIs2\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIstrcoll\fP() function shall compare the string pointed to by
\fIs1\fP to the string pointed to by \fIs2\fP, both
interpreted as appropriate to the \fILC_COLLATE\fP category of the
current locale.
.LP
The
\fIstrcoll\fP() function shall not change the setting of \fIerrno\fP
if successful.
.LP
Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application
wishing to check for error situations should set
\fIerrno\fP to 0, then call \fIstrcoll\fP(), then check \fIerrno\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIstrcoll\fP() shall return an integer
greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according to
whether the string pointed to by \fIs1\fP is greater than, equal to,
or less than the string pointed to by \fIs2\fP when both are
interpreted as appropriate to the current locale.  On error, \fIstrcoll\fP()
may set \fIerrno\fP, but no return
value is reserved to indicate an error. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIstrcoll\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIs1\fP or \fIs2\fP arguments contain characters outside the
domain of the collating sequence.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Comparing Nodes
.LP
The following example uses an application-defined function, \fInode_compare\fP(),
to compare two nodes based on an alphabetical
ordering of the \fIstring\fP field.
