.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
int puts(const char *\fP\fIs\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIputs\fP() function shall write the string pointed to by \fIs\fP,
followed by a <newline>, to the standard output
stream \fIstdout\fP. The terminating null byte shall not be written.
.LP
The
\fIst_ctime\fP and \fIst_mtime\fP fields of the file shall be marked
for update between the successful execution of \fIputs\fP()
and the next successful completion of a call to \fIfflush\fP() or
\fIfclose\fP() on the same stream or a call to \fIexit\fP()
or \fIabort\fP(). 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIputs\fP() shall return a non-negative
number. Otherwise, it shall return EOF, shall set an error
indicator for the stream,  and \fIerrno\fP shall be set to indicate
the error. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
Refer to \fIfputc\fP().
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Printing to Standard Output
.LP
The following example gets the current time, converts it to a string
using \fIlocaltime\fP() and \fIasctime\fP(), and prints it to
standard output using \fIputs\fP(). It then prints the number of minutes
to an event for which it is waiting.
