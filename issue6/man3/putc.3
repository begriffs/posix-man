.SH NAME
putc \- put a byte on a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
int putc(int\fP \fIc\fP\fB, FILE *\fP\fIstream\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIputc\fP() function shall be equivalent to \fIfputc\fP(), except
that if it is
implemented as a macro it may evaluate \fIstream\fP more than once,
so the argument should never be an expression with side
effects.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Refer to \fIfputc\fP().
.SH ERRORS
.LP
Refer to \fIfputc\fP().
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Since it may be implemented as a macro, \fIputc\fP() may treat a \fIstream\fP
argument with side effects incorrectly. In
particular, \fIputc\fP(\fIc\fP,*\fIf\fP++) does not necessarily work
correctly. Therefore, use of this function is not
recommended in such situations; \fIfputc\fP() should be used instead.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
