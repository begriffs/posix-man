.SH NAME
ldiv, lldiv \- compute quotient and remainder of a long division

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions shall compute the quotient and remainder of the division
of the numerator \fInumer\fP by the denominator
\fIdenom\fP. If the division is inexact, the resulting quotient is
the \fBlong\fP integer (for the \fIldiv\fP() function) or
\fBlong long\fP integer (for the \fIlldiv\fP() function) of lesser
magnitude that is the nearest to the algebraic quotient. If
the result cannot be represented, the behavior is undefined; otherwise,
\fIquot\fP\ *\ \fIdenom\fP+\fIrem\fP shall equal
\fInumer\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIldiv\fP() function shall return a structure of type \fBldiv_t\fP,
comprising both the quotient and the remainder. The
structure shall include the following members, in any order:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBlong   quot;    /* Quotient */
long   rem;     /* Remainder */
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The \fIlldiv\fP() function shall return a structure of type \fBlldiv_t\fP,
