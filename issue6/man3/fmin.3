.SH NAME
fmin, fminf, fminl \- determine minimum numeric value of two floating-point
numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS

double fmin(double\fP \fIx\fP\fB, double\fP \fIy\fP\fB);
.br
float fminf(float\fP \fIx\fP\fB, float\fP \fIy\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions shall determine the minimum numeric value of their
arguments. NaN arguments shall be treated as missing data: if
one argument is a NaN and the other numeric, then these functions
shall choose the numeric value.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the minimum
numeric value of their arguments.
.LP
If just one argument is a NaN, the other argument shall be returned.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP and \fIy\fP are NaN, a NaN shall be returned. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
