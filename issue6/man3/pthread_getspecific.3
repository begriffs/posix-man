.SH NAME
pthread_getspecific, pthread_setspecific \- thread-specific data management
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <pthread.h>
.br
.sp
void *pthread_getspecific(pthread_key_t\fP \fIkey\fP\fB);
.br
int pthread_setspecific(pthread_key_t\fP \fIkey\fP\fB, const void
*\fP\fIvalue\fP\fB); \fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIpthread_getspecific\fP() function shall return the value currently
bound to the specified \fIkey\fP on behalf of the
calling thread.
.LP
The \fIpthread_setspecific\fP() function shall associate a thread-specific
\fIvalue\fP with a \fIkey\fP obtained via a
previous call to \fIpthread_key_create\fP(). Different threads may
bind
different values to the same key. These values are typically pointers
to blocks of dynamically allocated memory that have been
reserved for use by the calling thread.
.LP
The effect of calling \fIpthread_getspecific\fP() or \fIpthread_setspecific\fP()
with a \fIkey\fP value not obtained from \fIpthread_key_create\fP()
or after \fIkey\fP has been deleted with \fIpthread_key_delete\fP()
is undefined.
.LP
Both \fIpthread_getspecific\fP() and \fIpthread_setspecific\fP() may
be called from a thread-specific data destructor
function. A call to \fIpthread_getspecific\fP() for the thread-specific
data key being destroyed shall return the value NULL,
unless the value is changed (after the destructor starts) by a call
to \fIpthread_setspecific\fP(). Calling
\fIpthread_setspecific\fP() from a thread-specific data destructor
routine may result either in lost storage (after at least
PTHREAD_DESTRUCTOR_ITERATIONS attempts at destruction) or in an infinite
loop.
.LP
Both functions may be implemented as macros.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIpthread_getspecific\fP() function shall return the thread-specific
data value associated with the given \fIkey\fP. If
no thread-specific data value is associated with \fIkey\fP, then the
value NULL shall be returned.
.LP
If successful, the \fIpthread_setspecific\fP() function shall return
zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are returned from \fIpthread_getspecific\fP().
.LP
The \fIpthread_setspecific\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient memory exists to associate the value with the key.
.sp
.LP
The \fIpthread_setspecific\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The key value is invalid.
.sp
.LP
These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Performance and ease-of-use of \fIpthread_getspecific\fP() are critical
for functions that rely on maintaining state in
thread-specific data. Since no errors are required to be detected
by it, and since the only error that could be detected is the use
of an invalid key, the function to \fIpthread_getspecific\fP() has
been designed to favor speed and simplicity over error
reporting.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
