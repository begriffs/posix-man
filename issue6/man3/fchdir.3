.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfchdir\fP() function shall be equivalent to \fIchdir\fP() except
that the
directory that is to be the new current working directory is specified
by the file descriptor \fIfildes\fP.
.LP
A conforming application can obtain a file descriptor for a file of
type directory using \fIopen\fP(), provided that the file status flags
and access modes do not contain O_WRONLY or
O_RDWR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIfchdir\fP() shall return 0. Otherwise,
it shall return -1 and set \fIerrno\fP to indicate the
error. On failure the current working directory shall remain unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIfchdir\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EACCES
Search permission is denied for the directory referenced by \fIfildes\fP.
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIfildes\fP argument is not an open file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B ENOTDIR
The open file descriptor \fIfildes\fP does not refer to a directory.
