.SH NAME
getwc \- get a wide character from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>

#include <wchar.h>
.br
.sp
wint_t getwc(FILE *\fP\fIstream\fP\fB);

\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgetwc\fP() function shall be equivalent to \fIfgetwc\fP(),
except that if it is
implemented as a macro it may evaluate \fIstream\fP more than once,
so the argument should never be an expression with side
effects.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Refer to \fIfgetwc\fP().
.SH ERRORS
.LP
Refer to \fIfgetwc\fP().
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Since it may be implemented as a macro, \fIgetwc\fP() may treat incorrectly
a \fIstream\fP argument with side effects. In
particular, \fIgetwc\fP(*\fIf\fP++) does not necessarily work as expected.
Therefore, use of this function is not recommended; \fIfgetwc\fP()
should be used instead.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
