.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The first time \fIposix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id\fP() is called,
the function shall return in the variable pointed to by
\fIevent\fP the first trace event type identifier of the list of trace
events of the trace stream identified by the \fItrid\fP
argument. Successive calls to \fIposix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id\fP()
return in the variable pointed to by \fIevent\fP the
next trace event type identifier in that same list. Each time a trace
event type identifier is successfully written into the
variable pointed to by the \fIevent\fP argument, the variable pointed
to by the \fIunavailable\fP argument shall be set to zero.
When no more trace event type identifiers are available, and so none
is returned, the variable pointed to by the \fIunavailable\fP
argument shall be set to a value different from zero.
.LP
The \fIposix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind\fP() function shall reset
the next trace event type identifier to be read to the first
trace event type identifier from the list of trace events used in
the trace stream identified by \fItrid\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value of
zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error
number.
.LP
The \fIposix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id\fP() function stores the
trace event type identifier value in the object pointed to
by \fIevent\fP, if successful.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fItrid\fP argument was not a valid trace stream identifier.
