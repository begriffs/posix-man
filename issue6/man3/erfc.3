.SH NAME
erfc, erfcf, erfcl \- complementary error functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <math.h>
.br
.sp
double erfc(double\fP \fIx\fP\fB);
.br
float erfcf(float\fP \fIx\fP\fB);
.br
long double erfcl(long double\fP \fIx\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions shall compute the complementary error function 1.0
- \fIerf\fP(\fIx\fP).
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to zero and call
\fIfeclearexcept\fP(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if \fIerrno\fP is non-zero or
\fIfetestexcept\fP(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW)
is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the value
of the complementary error function.
.LP
If the correct value would cause underflow and is not representable,
a range error may occur and  either 0.0 (if
representable), or  an implementation-defined value shall be
returned.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is \(+-0, +1 shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is -Inf, +2 shall be returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is +Inf, +0 shall be returned.
.LP
If the correct value would cause underflow and is representable, a
range error may occur and the correct value shall be
returned. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions may fail if:
.TP 7
Range\ Error
The result underflows. 
.LP
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero,
then \fIerrno\fP shall be set to [ERANGE]. If the
integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero,
then the underflow floating-point exception shall be
raised.
.sp
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIerfc\fP() function is provided because of the extreme loss
of relative accuracy if \fIerf\fP(\fIx\fP) is called for
large \fIx\fP and the result subtracted from 1.0.
.LP
Note for IEEE\ Std\ 754-1985 \fBdouble\fP, 26.55 < \fIx\fP implies
\fIerfc\fP( \fIx\fP) has underflowed.
.LP
On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
& MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of
each other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
