.SH NAME
fdatasync \- synchronize the data of a file (\fBREALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <unistd.h>
.br
.sp
int fdatasync(int\fP \fIfildes\fP\fB); \fP
\fB

\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfdatasync\fP() function shall force all currently queued I/O
operations associated with the file indicated by file
descriptor \fIfildes\fP to the synchronized I/O completion state.
.LP
The functionality shall be equivalent to \fIfsync\fP() with the symbol
_POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO defined, with the exception that all I/O operations
shall be completed as defined for synchronized I/O data
integrity completion.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
If successful, the \fIfdatasync\fP() function shall return the value
0; otherwise, the function shall return the value -1 and
set \fIerrno\fP to indicate the error. If the \fIfdatasync\fP() function
fails, outstanding I/O operations are not guaranteed to
have been completed.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIfdatasync\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIfildes\fP argument is not a valid file descriptor open for
writing.
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
This implementation does not support synchronized I/O for this file.
.sp
.LP
In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail, \fIfdatasync\fP()
shall return the error conditions defined for \fIread\fP() and \fIwrite\fP().
