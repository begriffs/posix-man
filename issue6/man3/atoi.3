.SH NAME
atoi \- convert a string to an integer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdlib.h>
.br
.sp
int atoi(const char *\fP\fIstr\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The call \fIatoi\fP(\fIstr\fP) shall be equivalent to:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB(int) strtol(str, (char **)NULL, 10)
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
except that the handling of errors may differ. If the value cannot
be represented, the behavior is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIatoi\fP() function shall return the converted value if the
value can be represented.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Converting an Argument
.LP
The following example checks for proper usage of the program. If there
is an argument and the decimal conversion of this
argument (obtained using \fIatoi\fP()) is greater than 0, then the
program has a valid number of minutes to wait for an event.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
\&...
int minutes_to_event;
\&...
if (argc < 2 || ((minutes_to_event = atoi (argv[1]))) <= 0) {
   fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s minutes\\n", argv[0]); exit(1);
}
\&...
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIatoi\fP() function is subsumed by \fIstrtol\fP() but is retained
because it is
used extensively in existing code. If the number is not known to be
in range, \fIstrtol\fP() should be used because \fIatoi\fP() is not
required to perform any error
checking.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
