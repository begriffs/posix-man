.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions shall provide for explicit application-level locking
of stdio ( \fBFILE *\fP) objects. These functions can be
used by a thread to delineate a sequence of I/O statements that are
executed as a unit.
.LP
The \fIflockfile\fP() function shall acquire for a thread ownership
of a ( \fBFILE *\fP) object.
.LP
The \fIftrylockfile\fP() function shall acquire for a thread ownership
of a ( \fBFILE *\fP) object if the object is available;
\fIftrylockfile\fP() is a non-blocking version of \fIflockfile\fP().
.LP
The \fIfunlockfile\fP() function shall relinquish the ownership granted
to the thread. The behavior is undefined if a thread
other than the current owner calls the \fIfunlockfile\fP() function.
.LP
The functions shall behave as if there is a lock count associated
with each ( \fBFILE *\fP) object. This count is implicitly
initialized to zero when the ( \fBFILE *\fP) object is created. The
( \fBFILE *\fP) object is unlocked when the count is zero.
When the count is positive, a single thread owns the ( \fBFILE *\fP)
object. When the \fIflockfile\fP() function is called, if
the count is zero or if the count is positive and the caller owns
the ( \fBFILE *\fP) object, the count shall be incremented.
Otherwise, the calling thread shall be suspended, waiting for the
count to return to zero. Each call to \fIfunlockfile\fP() shall
decrement the count. This allows matching calls to \fIflockfile\fP()
(or successful calls to \fIftrylockfile\fP()) and
\fIfunlockfile\fP() to be nested.
.LP
All functions that reference ( \fBFILE *\fP) objects shall behave
as if they use \fIflockfile\fP() and \fIfunlockfile\fP()
internally to obtain ownership of these ( \fBFILE *\fP) objects.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
None for \fIflockfile\fP() and \fIfunlockfile\fP().
.LP
The \fIftrylockfile\fP() function shall return zero for success and
non-zero to indicate that the lock cannot be acquired.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Applications using these functions may be subject to priority inversion,
as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 3.285, Priority Inversion.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fIflockfile\fP() and \fIfunlockfile\fP() functions provide an
orthogonal mutual-exclusion lock for each \fBFILE\fP. The
\fIftrylockfile\fP() function provides a non-blocking attempt to acquire
a file lock, analogous to \fIpthread_mutex_trylock\fP().
.LP
These locks behave as if they are the same as those used internally
by \fIstdio\fP for thread-safety. This both provides
thread-safety of these functions without requiring a second level
of internal locking and allows functions in \fIstdio\fP to be
implemented in terms of other \fIstdio\fP functions.
.LP
Application writers and implementors should be aware that there are
potential deadlock problems on \fBFILE\fP objects. For
example, the line-buffered flushing semantics of \fIstdio\fP (requested
via {_IOLBF}) require that certain input operations
sometimes cause the buffered contents of implementation-defined line-buffered
output streams to be flushed. If two threads each
hold the lock on the other's \fBFILE\fP, deadlock ensues. This type
of deadlock can be avoided by acquiring \fBFILE\fP locks in a
consistent order. In particular, the line-buffered output stream deadlock
can typically be avoided by acquiring locks on input
streams before locks on output streams if a thread would be acquiring
both.
.LP
In summary, threads sharing \fIstdio\fP streams with other threads
can use \fIflockfile\fP() and \fIfunlockfile\fP() to cause
sequences of I/O performed by a single thread to be kept bundled.
The only case where the use of \fIflockfile\fP() and
\fIfunlockfile\fP() is required is to provide a scope protecting uses
of the
\fI*_unlocked\fP() functions/macros. This moves the cost/performance
tradeoff to the optimal
point.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
