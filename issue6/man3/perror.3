.SH NAME
perror \- write error messages to standard error
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
void perror(const char *\fP\fIs\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIperror\fP() function shall map the error number accessed through
the symbol \fIerrno\fP to a language-dependent error
message, which shall be written to the standard error stream as follows:
.IP " *" 3
First (if \fIs\fP is not a null pointer and the character pointed
to by \fIs\fP is not the null byte), the string pointed to
by \fIs\fP followed by a colon and a <space>.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
Then an error message string followed by a <newline>.
.LP
.LP
The contents of the error message strings shall be the same as those
returned by \fIstrerror\fP() with argument \fIerrno\fP.
.LP
The
\fIperror\fP() function shall mark the file associated with the standard
error stream as having been written (\fIst_ctime\fP,
\fIst_mtime\fP marked for update) at some time between its successful
completion and \fIexit\fP(), \fIabort\fP(), or the completion of \fIfflush\fP()
or \fIfclose\fP() on \fIstderr\fP. 
.LP
The \fIperror\fP() function shall not change the orientation of the
standard error stream.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIperror\fP() function shall not return a value.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Printing an Error Message for a Function
.LP
The following example replaces \fIbufptr\fP with a buffer that is
the necessary size. If an error occurs, the \fIperror\fP()
function prints a message and the program exits.
