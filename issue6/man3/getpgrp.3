4.3 BSD provides a \fIgetpgrp\fP() function that returns the process
group ID for a specified process. Although this function
supports job control, all known job control shells always specify
the calling process with this function. Thus, the simpler System
V \fIgetpgrp\fP() suffices, and the added complexity of the 4.3 BSD
\fIgetpgrp\fP() is provided by the XSI extension \fIgetpgid\fP().
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
