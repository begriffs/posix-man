.\" dirname 
.SH NAME
dirname \- report the parent directory name of a file pathname
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <libgen.h>
.br
.sp
char *dirname(char *\fP\fIpath\fP\fB); \fP
\fB
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIdirname\fP() function shall take a pointer to a character string
that contains a pathname, and return a pointer to a
string that is a pathname of the parent directory of that file. Trailing
\fB'/'\fP characters in the path are not counted as
part of the path.
.LP
If \fIpath\fP does not contain a \fB'/'\fP, then \fIdirname\fP()
shall return a pointer to the string \fB"."\fP . If
\fIpath\fP is a null pointer or points to an empty string, \fIdirname\fP()
shall return a pointer to the string \fB"."\fP
\&.
.LP
The \fIdirname\fP() function need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIdirname\fP() function shall return a pointer to a string that
is the parent directory of \fIpath\fP. If \fIpath\fP is
a null pointer or points to an empty string, a pointer to a string
\fB"."\fP is returned.
.LP
The \fIdirname\fP() function may modify the string pointed to by \fIpath\fP,
and may return a pointer to static storage that
may then be overwritten by subsequent calls to \fIdirname\fP().
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The following code fragment reads a pathname, changes the current
working directory to the parent directory, and opens the
file.

the \fIdirname\fP() function.

.SS Changing the Current Directory to the Parent Directory
.LP
The following program fragment reads a pathname, changes the current
working directory to the parent directory, and opens the
file.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB#include <unistd.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <libgen.h>
\&...
char path[PATH_MAX], *pathcopy;

.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIdirname\fP() and \fIbasename\fP() functions together yield
a complete
pathname. The expression \fIdirname\fP(\fIpath\fP) obtains the pathname
of the directory where \fIbasename\fP(\fIpath\fP) is
found.
.LP
Since the meaning of the leading \fB"//"\fP is implementation-defined,
\fIdirname\fP(" \fB//foo\fP) may return either
\fB"//"\fP or \fB'/'\fP (but nothing else).
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
