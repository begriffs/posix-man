.SH NAME
wctob \- wide-character to single-byte conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwctob\fP() function shall determine whether \fIc\fP corresponds
to a member of the extended character set whose
character representation is a single byte when in the initial shift
state.
.LP
The behavior of this function shall be affected by the \fILC_CTYPE\fP
category of the current locale.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwctob\fP() function shall return EOF if \fIc\fP does not correspond
to a character with length one in the initial shift
state. Otherwise, it shall return the single-byte representation of
that character as an \fBunsigned char\fP converted to
\fBint\fP.
.SH ERRORS
