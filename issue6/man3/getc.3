.SH NAME
getc \- get a byte from a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
int getc(FILE *\fP\fIstream\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgetc\fP() function shall be equivalent to \fIfgetc\fP(), except
that if it is implemented as
a macro it may evaluate \fIstream\fP more than once, so the argument
should never be an expression with side effects.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Refer to \fIfgetc\fP().
.SH ERRORS
.LP
Refer to \fIfgetc\fP().
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
If the integer value returned by \fIgetc\fP() is stored into a variable
of type \fBchar\fP and then compared against the
integer constant EOF, the comparison may never succeed, because sign-extension
of a variable of type \fBchar\fP on widening to
integer is implementation-defined.
.LP
Since it may be implemented as a macro, \fIgetc\fP() may treat incorrectly
a \fIstream\fP argument with side effects. In
particular, \fIgetc\fP(*\fIf\fP++) does not necessarily work as expected.
Therefore, use of this function should be preceded by
\fB"#undef getc"\fP in such situations; \fIfgetc\fP() could also be
used.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
