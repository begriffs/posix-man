.SH NAME
setregid \- set real and effective group IDs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <unistd.h>
.br
.sp
int setregid(gid_t\fP \fIrgid\fP\fB, gid_t\fP \fIegid\fP\fB); \fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIsetregid\fP() function shall set the real and effective group
IDs of the calling process.
.LP
If \fIrgid\fP is -1, the real group ID shall not be changed; if \fIegid\fP
is -1, the effective group ID shall not be
changed.
.LP
The real and effective group IDs may be set to different values in
the same call.
.LP
Only a process with appropriate privileges can set the real group
ID and the effective group ID to any valid value.
.LP
A non-privileged process can set either the real group ID to the saved
set-group-ID from one of the \fIexec\fP family of functions, or the
effective group ID to the saved set-group-ID or the real group
ID.
.LP
Any supplementary group IDs of the calling process remain unchanged.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate the error, and
neither of the group IDs are changed.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIsetregid\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of the \fIrgid\fP or \fIegid\fP argument is invalid or out-of-range.
.TP 7
.B EPERM
The process does not have appropriate privileges and a change other
than changing the real group ID to the saved set-group-ID,
or changing the effective group ID to the real group ID or the saved
set-group-ID, was requested.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
If a set-group-ID process sets its effective group ID to its real
group ID, it can still set its effective group ID back to the
saved set-group-ID.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
