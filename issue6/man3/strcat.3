.SH SYNOPSIS

\fIs2\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIstrcat\fP() function shall append a copy of the string pointed
to by \fIs2\fP (including the terminating null byte) to
the end of the string pointed to by \fIs1\fP. The initial byte of
\fIs2\fP overwrites the null byte at the end of \fIs1\fP. If
copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIstrcat\fP() function shall return \fIs1\fP; no return value
is reserved to indicate an error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
