.SH NAME
memccpy \- copy bytes in memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <string.h>
.br
.sp
void *memccpy(void *restrict\fP \fIs1\fP\fB, const void *restrict\fP
\fIs2\fP\fB,
.br
\ \ \ \ \ \  int\fP \fIc\fP\fB, size_t\fP \fIn\fP\fB); \fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fImemccpy\fP() function shall copy bytes from memory area \fIs2\fP
into \fIs1\fP, stopping after the first occurrence of
byte \fIc\fP (converted to an \fBunsigned char\fP) is copied, or after
\fIn\fP bytes are copied, whichever comes first. If
copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fImemccpy\fP() function shall return a pointer to the byte after
the copy of \fIc\fP in \fIs1\fP, or a null pointer if
\fIc\fP was not found in the first \fIn\fP bytes of \fIs2\fP.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES

None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fImemccpy\fP() function does not check for the overflow of the
receiving memory area.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
