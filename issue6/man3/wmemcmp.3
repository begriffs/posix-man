.SH NAME
wmemcmp \- compare wide characters in memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <wchar.h>
.br
.sp
int wmemcmp(const wchar_t *\fP\fIws1\fP\fB, const wchar_t *\fP\fIws2\fP\fB,
size_t\fP \fIn\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwmemcmp\fP() function shall compare the first \fIn\fP wide
characters of the object pointed to by \fIws1\fP to the
first \fIn\fP wide characters of the object pointed to by \fIws2\fP.
This function shall not be affected by locale and all
\fBwchar_t\fP values shall be treated identically. The null wide character
and \fBwchar_t\fP values not corresponding to valid
characters shall not be treated specially.
.LP
If \fIn\fP is zero, the application shall ensure that \fIws1\fP and
\fIws2\fP are valid pointers, and the function shall
behave as if the two objects compare equal.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwmemcmp\fP() function shall return an integer greater than,
equal to, or less than zero, respectively, as the object
pointed to by \fIws1\fP is greater than, equal to, or less than the
object pointed to by \fIws2\fP.
