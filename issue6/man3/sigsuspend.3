.SH NAME
sigsuspend \- wait for a signal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <signal.h>
.br
.sp
int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *\fP\fIsigmask\fP\fB); \fP
\fB
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIsigsuspend\fP() function shall replace the current signal mask
of the calling thread with the set of signals pointed to
by \fIsigmask\fP and then suspend the thread until delivery of a signal
whose action is either to execute a signal-catching
function or to terminate the process. This shall not cause any other
signals that may have been pending on the process to become
pending on the thread.
.LP
If the action is to terminate the process then \fIsigsuspend\fP()
shall never return. If the action is to execute a
signal-catching function, then \fIsigsuspend\fP() shall return after
the signal-catching function returns, with the signal mask
restored to the set that existed prior to the \fIsigsuspend\fP() call.
.LP
It is not possible to block signals that cannot be ignored. This is
enforced by the system without causing an error to be
indicated.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Since \fIsigsuspend\fP() suspends thread execution indefinitely, there
is no successful completion return value. If a return
occurs, -1 shall be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIsigsuspend\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINTR
A signal is caught by the calling process and control is returned
from the signal-catching function.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Normally, at the beginning of a critical code section, a specified
set of signals is blocked using the \fIsigprocmask\fP() function.
When the thread has completed the critical section and needs to
wait for the previously blocked signal(s), it pauses by calling \fIsigsuspend\fP()
with the mask that was returned by the \fIsigprocmask\fP() call.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
