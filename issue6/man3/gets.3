.SH NAME
gets \- get a string from a stdin stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
char *gets(char *\fP\fIs\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgets\fP() function shall read bytes from the standard input
stream, \fIstdin\fP, into the array pointed to by \fIs\fP,
until a <newline> is read or an end-of-file condition is encountered.
Any <newline> shall be discarded and a null byte
shall be placed immediately after the last byte read into the array.
.LP
The
\fIgets\fP() function may mark the \fIst_atime\fP field of the file
associated with \fIstream\fP for update. The \fIst_atime\fP
field shall be marked for update by the first successful execution
of \fIfgetc\fP(), \fIfgets\fP(), \fIfread\fP(), \fIgetc\fP(), \fIgetchar\fP(),
\fIgets\fP(), \fIfscanf\fP(), or \fIscanf\fP() using \fIstream\fP
that
returns data not supplied by a prior call to \fIungetc\fP(). 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIgets\fP() shall return \fIs\fP. If
the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for
the stream shall be set and \fIgets\fP() shall return a null pointer.
If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream
shall be set, \fIgets\fP() shall return a null pointer,  and set
\fIerrno\fP to indicate the error. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
Refer to \fIfgetc\fP().
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Reading a line that overflows the array pointed to by \fIs\fP results
in undefined behavior. The use of \fIfgets\fP() is recommended.
.LP
Since the user cannot specify the length of the buffer passed to \fIgets\fP(),
use of this function is discouraged. The length
of the string read is unlimited. It is possible to overflow this buffer
in such a way as to cause applications to fail, or possible
system security violations.
.LP
It is recommended that the \fIfgets\fP() function should be used to
read input lines.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
