.SH NAME
pthread_kill \- send a signal to a thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <signal.h>
.br
.sp
int pthread_kill(pthread_t\fP \fIthread\fP\fB, int\fP \fIsig\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIpthread_kill\fP() function shall request that a signal be delivered
to the specified thread.
.LP
As in \fIkill\fP(), if \fIsig\fP is zero, error checking shall be
performed but no signal
shall actually be sent.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the function shall return a value of zero.
Otherwise, the function shall return an error number. If
the \fIpthread_kill\fP() function fails, no signal shall be sent.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIpthread_kill\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B ESRCH
No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the given
thread ID.
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of the \fIsig\fP argument is an invalid or unsupported signal
number.
.sp
.LP
The \fIpthread_kill\fP() function shall not return an error code of
[EINTR].
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIpthread_kill\fP() function provides a mechanism for asynchronously
directing a signal at a thread in the calling
process. This could be used, for example, by one thread to affect
broadcast delivery of a signal to a set of threads.
.LP
Note that \fIpthread_kill\fP() only causes the signal to be handled
in the context of the given thread; the signal action
(termination or stopping) affects the process as a whole.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
