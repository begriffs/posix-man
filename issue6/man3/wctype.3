wctype_t wctype(const char *\fP\fIproperty\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwctype\fP() function is defined for valid character class names
as defined in the current locale. The \fIproperty\fP
argument is a string identifying a generic character class for which
codeset-specific type information is required. The following
character class names shall be defined in all locales:
.TS C
center; lw(26) lw(26) lw(26).
T{
\fB
.br
alnum
.br
alpha
.br
blank
.br
cntrl
.br
\fP
T}	T{
\fB
.br

.br

.br

.br
print
.br
\fP
T}	T{
\fB
.br
punct
.br
space
.br
upper
.br
xdigit
.br
\fP
T}
.TE
.LP
Additional character class names defined in the locale definition
file (category \fILC_CTYPE )\fP can also be specified.
.LP
The function shall return a value of type \fBwctype_t\fP, which can
be used as the second argument to subsequent calls of \fIiswctype\fP().
The \fIwctype\fP() function shall determine values of \fBwctype_t\fP
according to the rules of the coded character set defined by character
type information in the program's locale (category
\fILC_CTYPE ).\fP The values returned by \fIwctype\fP() shall be valid
until a call to \fIsetlocale\fP() that modifies the category \fILC_CTYPE
\&.\fP
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwctype\fP() function shall return 0 if the given character
class name is not valid for the current locale (category
\fILC_CTYPE );\fP otherwise, it shall return an object of type \fBwctype_t\fP
that can be used in calls to \fIiswctype\fP().
