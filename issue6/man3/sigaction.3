.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIsigaction\fP() function allows the calling process to examine
and/or specify the action to be associated with a specific
signal. The argument \fIsig\fP specifies the signal; acceptable values
are defined in \fI<signal.h>\fP.
.LP
The structure \fBsigaction\fP, used to describe an action to be taken,
is defined in the \fI<signal.h>\fP header to include at least the
following members:
.TS C
center; lw(15) l lw(30).

.LP
The storage occupied by \fIsa_handler\fP and \fIsa_sigaction\fP may
overlap, and a conforming application shall not use both
simultaneously.
.LP
If the argument \fIact\fP is not a null pointer, it points to a structure
specifying the action to be associated with the
specified signal. If the argument \fIoact\fP is not a null pointer,
the action previously associated with the signal is stored in
the location pointed to by the argument \fIoact\fP. If the argument
\fIact\fP is a null pointer, signal handling is unchanged;
thus, the call can be used to enquire about the current handling of
a given signal. The SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals shall not be
added to the signal mask using this mechanism; this restriction shall
be enforced by the system without causing an error to be
indicated.
.LP
If the SA_SIGINFO flag (see below) is cleared in the \fIsa_flags\fP
field of the \fBsigaction\fP structure, the
\fIsa_handler\fP field identifies the action to be associated with
the specified signal.  If the
SA_SIGINFO flag is set in the \fIsa_flags\fP field, and the implementation
supports the Realtime Signals Extension option or the
XSI Extension option, the \fIsa_sigaction\fP field specifies a signal-catching
function.  If the SA_SIGINFO bit is cleared and the \fIsa_handler\fP
field specifies a signal-catching function,
or if the SA_SIGINFO bit is set, the \fIsa_mask\fP field identifies
a set of signals that shall be added to the signal mask of the
thread before the signal-catching function is invoked. If the \fIsa_handler\fP
field specifies a signal-catching function, the
\fIsa_mask\fP field identifies a set of signals that shall be added
to the process' signal mask before the signal-catching
function is invoked.
.LP
The \fIsa_flags\fP field can be used to modify the behavior of the
specified signal.
.LP
The following flags, defined in the \fI<signal.h>\fP header, can be
set in
\fIsa_flags\fP:
.TP 7
SA_NOCLDSTOP
Do not generate SIGCHLD when children stop  or stopped children
continue.  
.LP
If \fIsig\fP is SIGCHLD and the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag is not set in \fIsa_flags\fP,
and the implementation supports the SIGCHLD
signal, then a SIGCHLD signal shall be generated for the calling process
whenever any of its child processes stop  and a
SIGCHLD signal may be generated for the calling process whenever any
of its stopped child processes are continued. If \fIsig\fP is SIGCHLD
and the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag is set in
\fIsa_flags\fP, then the implementation shall not generate a SIGCHLD
signal in this way.
.TP 7
SA_ONSTACK
If set and an alternate signal stack has been declared with \fIsigaltstack\fP(),
the
signal shall be delivered to the calling process on that stack. Otherwise,
the signal shall be delivered on the current stack. 
.TP 7
SA_RESETHAND
If set, the disposition of the signal shall be reset to SIG_DFL and
the SA_SIGINFO flag shall be cleared on entry to the signal
handler.  
.TP 7
\fBNote:\fP
.RS
SIGILL and SIGTRAP cannot be automatically reset when delivered; the
system silently enforces this restriction.
.RE
.sp
Otherwise, the disposition of the signal shall not be modified on
entry to the signal handler. 
.LP
In addition, if this flag is set, \fIsigaction\fP() behaves as if
the SA_NODEFER flag were also set. 
.TP 7
SA_RESTART
This flag affects the behavior of interruptible functions; that is,
those specified to fail with \fIerrno\fP set to [EINTR]. If
set, and a function specified as interruptible is interrupted by this
signal, the function shall restart and shall not fail with
[EINTR] unless otherwise specified. If the flag is not set, interruptible
functions interrupted by this signal shall fail with
\fIerrno\fP set to [EINTR]. 
.TP 7
SA_SIGINFO
If cleared and the signal is caught, the signal-catching function
shall be entered as: 
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBvoid func(int\fP \fIsigno\fP\fB);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
where \fIsigno\fP is the only argument to the signal-catching function.
In this case, the application shall use the
\fIsa_handler\fP member to describe the signal-catching function and
the application shall not modify the \fIsa_sigaction\fP
member.
.LP
If SA_SIGINFO is set and the signal is caught, the signal-catching
function shall be entered as:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBvoid func(int\fP \fIsigno\fP\fB, siginfo_t *\fP\fIinfo\fP\fB, void *\fP\fIcontext\fP\fB);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
where two additional arguments are passed to the signal-catching function.
The second argument shall point to an object of type
\fBsiginfo_t\fP explaining the reason why the signal was generated;
the third argument can be cast to a pointer to an object of
type \fBucontext_t\fP to refer to the receiving process' context that
was interrupted when the signal was delivered. In this case,
the application shall use the \fIsa_sigaction\fP member to describe
the signal-catching function and the application shall not
modify the \fIsa_handler\fP member.
.LP
The \fIsi_signo\fP member contains the system-generated signal number.
.LP
The \fIsi_errno\fP member may contain implementation-defined additional
error information; if non-zero, it contains an error
number identifying the condition that caused the signal to be generated.
.LP
The \fIsi_code\fP member contains a code identifying the cause of
the signal. 
.LP
If the value of \fIsi_code\fP is less than or equal to 0, then the
signal was generated by a process and \fIsi_pid\fP and
\fIsi_uid\fP, respectively, indicate the process ID and the real user
ID of the sender.  The \fI<signal.h>\fP header description contains
information about the signal-specific contents of the elements of
the \fBsiginfo_t\fP type.
.TP 7
SA_NOCLDWAIT
If set, and \fIsig\fP equals SIGCHLD, child processes of the calling
processes shall not be transformed into zombie processes when
they terminate. If the calling process subsequently waits for its
children, and the process has no unwaited-for children that were
transformed into zombie processes, it shall block until all of its
children terminate, and \fIwait\fP(), \fIwaitid\fP(), and \fIwaitpid\fP()
shall fail and set \fIerrno\fP to [ECHILD]. Otherwise, terminating
child
processes shall be transformed into zombie processes, unless SIGCHLD
is set to SIG_IGN. 
.TP 7
SA_NODEFER
If set and \fIsig\fP is caught, \fIsig\fP shall not be added to the
process' signal mask on entry to the signal handler unless it
is included in \fIsa_mask\fP. Otherwise, \fIsig\fP shall always be
added to the process' signal mask on entry to the signal
handler. 
.sp
.LP
When a signal is caught by a signal-catching function installed by
\fIsigaction\fP(), a new signal mask is calculated and
installed for the duration of the signal-catching function (or until
a call to either \fIsigprocmask\fP() or \fIsigsuspend\fP() is
made). This mask is formed by taking the union of the current signal
mask and the value of the \fIsa_mask\fP for the signal being
delivered  unless SA_NODEFER or SA_RESETHAND is set,  and
then including the signal being delivered. If and when the user's
signal handler returns normally, the original signal mask is
restored.
.LP
Once an action is installed for a specific signal, it shall remain
installed until another action is explicitly requested (by
another call to \fIsigaction\fP()),  until the SA_RESETHAND flag
causes resetting of the handler, or until one of the \fIexec\fP
functions is called.
.LP
If the previous action for \fIsig\fP had been established by \fIsignal\fP(),
the values
of the fields returned in the structure pointed to by \fIoact\fP are
unspecified, and in particular \fIoact\fP->
\fIsa_handler\fP is not necessarily the same value passed to \fIsignal\fP().
However, if a
pointer to the same structure or a copy thereof is passed to a subsequent
call to \fIsigaction\fP() via the \fIact\fP argument,
handling of the signal shall be as if the original call to \fIsignal\fP()
were
repeated.
.LP
If \fIsigaction\fP() fails, no new signal handler is installed.
.LP
It is unspecified whether an attempt to set the action for a signal
that cannot be caught or ignored to SIG_DFL is ignored or
causes an error to be returned with \fIerrno\fP set to [EINVAL].
.LP
If SA_SIGINFO is not set in \fIsa_flags\fP, then the disposition of
subsequent occurrences of \fIsig\fP when it is already
pending is implementation-defined; the signal-catching function shall
be invoked with a single argument.  If the
implementation supports the Realtime Signals Extension option, and
if SA_SIGINFO is set in \fIsa_flags\fP, then subsequent
occurrences of \fIsig\fP generated by \fIsigqueue\fP() or as a result
of any
signal-generating function that supports the specification of an application-defined
value (when \fIsig\fP is already pending)
shall be queued in FIFO order until delivered or accepted; the signal-catching
function shall be invoked with three arguments. The
application specified value is passed to the signal-catching function
as the \fIsi_value\fP member of the \fBsiginfo_t\fP
structure. 
.LP
The result of the use of \fIsigaction\fP() and a \fIsigwait\fP() function
concurrently
within a process on the same signal is unspecified.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIsigaction\fP() shall return 0; otherwise,
-1 shall be returned, \fIerrno\fP shall be set to
indicate the error, and no new signal-catching function shall be installed.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIsigaction\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIsig\fP argument is not a valid signal number or an attempt
is made to catch a signal that cannot be caught or ignore a
signal that cannot be ignored.
.TP 7
.B ENOTSUP
The SA_SIGINFO bit flag is set in the \fIsa_flags\fP field of the
\fBsigaction\fP structure, and the implementation does not
support either the Realtime Signals Extension option, or the XSI Extension
option.
.sp
.LP
The \fIsigaction\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
An attempt was made to set the action to SIG_DFL for a signal that
cannot be caught or ignored (or both).
.sp
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIsigaction\fP() function supersedes the \fIsignal\fP() function,
and should be
used in preference. In particular, \fIsigaction\fP() and \fIsignal\fP()
should not be used
in the same process to control the same signal. The behavior of reentrant
functions, as defined in the DESCRIPTION, is as specified
by this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, regardless of invocation
from a signal-catching function. This is the only
intended meaning of the statement that reentrant functions may be
used in signal-catching functions without restrictions.
Applications must still consider all effects of such functions on
such things as data structures, files, and process state. In
particular, application writers need to consider the restrictions
on interactions when interrupting \fIsleep\fP() and interactions among
multiple handles for a file description. The fact that any
specific function is listed as reentrant does not necessarily mean
that invocation of that function from a signal-catching function
is recommended.
.LP
In order to prevent errors arising from interrupting non-reentrant
function calls, applications should protect calls to these
functions either by blocking the appropriate signals or through the
use of some programmatic semaphore (see \fIsemget\fP(), \fIsem_init\fP(),
\fIsem_open\fP(),
and so on). Note in particular that even the "safe" functions may
modify \fIerrno\fP; the signal-catching function, if not
executing as an independent thread, may want to save and restore its
value. Naturally, the same principles apply to the reentrancy
of application routines and asynchronous data access. Note that \fIlongjmp\fP()
and \fIsiglongjmp\fP() are not in the list of reentrant functions.
This is because the code
executing after \fIlongjmp\fP() and \fIsiglongjmp\fP() can call any
unsafe functions with the same danger as calling those unsafe
functions directly from the signal handler. Applications that use
\fIlongjmp\fP() and \fIsiglongjmp\fP() from within signal handlers
require rigorous protection in order to be
portable. Many of the other functions that are excluded from the list
are traditionally implemented using either \fImalloc\fP() or \fIfree\fP()
functions or the standard I/O
library, both of which traditionally use data structures in a non-reentrant
manner. Since any combination of different functions
using a common data structure can cause reentrancy problems, this
volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 does not define the
behavior when any unsafe function is called in a signal handler that
interrupts an unsafe function.
.LP
If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling \fIabort\fP(),
\fIkill\fP(), or \fIraise\fP(), the behavior is undefined if
the signal handler calls any function in the standard library other
than one of the functions listed in the table above or refers
to any object with static storage duration other than by assigning
a value to a static storage duration variable of type
\fBvolatile sig_atomic_t\fP. Furthermore, if such a call fails, the
value of \fIerrno\fP is unspecified.
.LP
Usually, the signal is executed on the stack that was in effect before
the signal was delivered. An alternate stack may be
specified to receive a subset of the signals being caught.
.LP
When the signal handler returns, the receiving process resumes execution
at the point it was interrupted unless the signal
handler makes other arrangements. If \fIlongjmp\fP() or \fI_longjmp\fP()
is used to leave the signal handler, then the signal mask must be
explicitly
restored by the process.
.LP
This volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 defines the third argument of
a signal handling function when SA_SIGINFO is set as
a \fBvoid *\fP instead of a \fBucontext_t *\fP, but without requiring
type checking. New applications should explicitly cast the
third argument of the signal handling function to \fBucontext_t *\fP.
.LP
The BSD optional four argument signal handling function is not supported
by this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001. The
BSD declaration would be:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBvoid handler(int\fP \fIsig\fP\fB, int\fP \fIcode\fP\fB, struct sigcontext *\fP\fIscp\fP\fB,
    char *\fP\fIaddr\fP\fB);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
where \fIsig\fP is the signal number, \fIcode\fP is additional information
on certain signals, \fIscp\fP is a pointer to the
\fBsigcontext\fP structure, and \fIaddr\fP is additional address information.
Much the same information is available in the
objects pointed to by the second argument of the signal handler specified
when SA_SIGINFO is set.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Although this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 requires that signals
that cannot be ignored shall not be added to the
signal mask when a signal-catching function is entered, there is no
explicit requirement that subsequent calls to
\fIsigaction\fP() reflect this in the information returned in the
\fIoact\fP argument. In other words, if SIGKILL is included in
the \fIsa_mask\fP field of \fIact\fP, it is unspecified whether or
not a subsequent call to \fIsigaction\fP() returns with
SIGKILL included in the \fIsa_mask\fP field of \fIoact\fP.
.LP
The SA_NOCLDSTOP flag, when supplied in the \fIact\fP-> \fIsa_flags\fP
parameter, allows overloading SIGCHLD with the
System V semantics that each SIGCLD signal indicates a single terminated
child. Most conforming applications that catch SIGCHLD are
expected to install signal-catching functions that repeatedly call
the \fIwaitpid\fP()
function with the WNOHANG flag set, acting on each child for which
status is returned, until \fIwaitpid\fP() returns zero. If stopped
children are not of interest, the use of the SA_NOCLDSTOP
flag can prevent the overhead from invoking the signal-catching routine
when they stop.
.LP
Some historical implementations also define other mechanisms for stopping
processes, such as the \fIptrace\fP() function. These
implementations usually do not generate a SIGCHLD signal when processes
stop due to this mechanism; however, that is beyond the
scope of this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001.
.LP
This volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 requires that calls to \fIsigaction\fP()
that supply a NULL \fIact\fP argument
succeed, even in the case of signals that cannot be caught or ignored
(that is, SIGKILL or SIGSTOP). The System V \fIsignal\fP() and BSD
\fIsigvec\fP() functions return [EINVAL] in these cases and, in this
respect, their behavior varies from \fIsigaction\fP().
.LP
This volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 requires that \fIsigaction\fP()
properly save and restore a signal action set up
by the ISO\ C standard \fIsignal\fP() function. However, there is
no guarantee that the
reverse is true, nor could there be given the greater amount of information
conveyed by the \fBsigaction\fP structure. Because of
this, applications should avoid using both functions for the same
signal in the same process. Since this cannot always be avoided
in case of general-purpose library routines, they should always be
implemented with \fIsigaction\fP().
.LP
It was intended that the \fIsignal\fP() function should be implementable
as a library
routine using \fIsigaction\fP().
.LP
The POSIX Realtime Extension extends the \fIsigaction\fP() function
as specified by the POSIX.1-1990 standard to allow the
application to request on a per-signal basis via an additional signal
action flag that the extra parameters, including the
application-defined signal value, if any, be passed to the signal-catching
function.
