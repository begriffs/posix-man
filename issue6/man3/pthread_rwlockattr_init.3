.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIpthread_rwlockattr_destroy\fP() function shall destroy a read-write
lock attributes object. A destroyed \fIattr\fP
attributes object can be reinitialized using \fIpthread_rwlockattr_init\fP();
the results of otherwise referencing the object
after it has been destroyed are undefined. An implementation may cause
\fIpthread_rwlockattr_destroy\fP() to set the object
referenced by \fIattr\fP to an invalid value.
.LP
The \fIpthread_rwlockattr_init\fP() function shall initialize a read-write
lock attributes object \fIattr\fP with the default
value for all of the attributes defined by the implementation.
.LP
Results are undefined if \fIpthread_rwlockattr_init\fP() is called
specifying an already initialized \fIattr\fP attributes
object.
.LP
After a read-write lock attributes object has been used to initialize
one or more read-write locks, any function affecting the
attributes object (including destruction) shall not affect any previously
initialized read-write locks.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
If successful, the \fIpthread_rwlockattr_destroy\fP() and \fIpthread_rwlockattr_init\fP()
functions shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIpthread_rwlockattr_destroy\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value specified by \fIattr\fP is invalid.
.sp
.LP
The \fIpthread_rwlockattr_init\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the read-write lock attributes
object.
.sp
.LP
These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
