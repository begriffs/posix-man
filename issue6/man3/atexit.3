.SH NAME
atexit \- register a function to run at process termination
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdlib.h>
.br
.sp
int atexit(void (*\fP\fIfunc\fP\fB)(void));
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIatexit\fP() function shall register the function pointed to
by \fIfunc\fP, to be called without arguments at normal
program termination. At normal program termination, all functions
registered by the \fIatexit\fP() function shall be called, in
the reverse order of their registration, except that a function is
called after any previously registered functions that had
already been called at the time it was registered. Normal termination
occurs either by a call to \fIexit\fP() or a return from \fImain\fP().
.LP
At least 32 functions can be registered with \fIatexit\fP().
.LP
After a successful call to any of the \fIexec\fP functions, any functions
previously
registered by \fIatexit\fP() shall no longer be registered. 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIatexit\fP() shall return 0; otherwise,
it shall return a non-zero value.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The functions registered by a call to \fIatexit\fP() must return to
ensure that all registered functions are called.
.LP
The application should call \fIsysconf\fP() to obtain the value of
{ATEXIT_MAX}, the
number of functions that can be registered. There is no way for an
application to tell how many functions have already been
registered with \fIatexit\fP().
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
