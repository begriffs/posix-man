.SH NAME
llrint, llrintf, llrintl \- round to the nearest integer value using
current rounding direction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <math.h>
.br
.sp
long long llrint(double\fP \fIx\fP\fB);
.br
long long llrintf(float\fP \fIx\fP\fB);
.br
long long llrintl(long double\fP \fIx\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions shall round their argument to the nearest integer
value, rounding according to the current rounding
direction.
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to zero and call
\fIfeclearexcept\fP(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these functions.
On return, if \fIerrno\fP is non-zero or
\fIfetestexcept\fP(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW)
is non-zero, an error has occurred.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the rounded
integer value.
.LP
If
\fIx\fP is NaN, a domain error shall occur, and an unspecified value
is returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is +Inf, a domain error shall occur and an unspecified
value is returned.
.LP
If \fIx\fP is -Inf, a domain error shall occur and an unspecified
value is returned.
.LP
If the correct value is positive and too large to represent as a \fBlong
long\fP, a domain error shall occur and an unspecified
value is returned.
.LP
If the correct value is negative and too large to represent as a \fBlong
long\fP, a domain error shall occur and an unspecified
value is returned. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
These functions shall fail if:
.TP 7
Domain\ Error
The \fIx\fP argument is NaN or \(+-Inf, or the correct value is not
representable as an integer. 
.LP
If the integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero,
then \fIerrno\fP shall be set to [EDOM]. If the
integer expression (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero,
then the invalid floating-point exception shall be raised.
.sp
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and (math_errhandling
& MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of
each other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
These functions provide floating-to-integer conversions. They round
according to the current rounding direction. If the rounded
value is outside the range of the return type, the numeric result
is unspecified and the invalid floating-point exception is
raised. When they raise no other floating-point exception and the
result differs from the argument, they raise the inexact
floating-point exception.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
