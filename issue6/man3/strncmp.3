.SH NAME
strncmp \- compare part of two strings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <string.h>
.br
.sp
int strncmp(const char *\fP\fIs1\fP\fB, const char *\fP\fIs2\fP\fB,
size_t\fP \fIn\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIstrncmp\fP() function shall compare not more than \fIn\fP bytes
(bytes that follow a null byte are not compared) from
the array pointed to by \fIs1\fP to the array pointed to by \fIs2\fP.
.LP
The sign of a non-zero return value is determined by the sign of the
difference between the values of the first pair of bytes
(both interpreted as type \fBunsigned char\fP) that differ in the
strings being compared.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIstrncmp\fP() shall return an integer
greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the possibly
null-terminated array pointed to by \fIs1\fP is greater than, equal
to, or less than the possibly null-terminated array pointed to
by \fIs2\fP respectively.
