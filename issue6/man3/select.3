.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIpselect\fP() function shall examine the file descriptor sets
whose addresses are passed in the \fIreadfds\fP,
\fIwritefds\fP, and \fIerrorfds\fP parameters to see whether some
of their descriptors are ready for reading, are ready for
writing, or have an exceptional condition pending, respectively.
.LP
The \fIselect\fP() function shall be equivalent to the \fIpselect\fP()
function, except as follows:
.IP " *" 3
For the \fIselect\fP() function, the timeout period is given in seconds
and microseconds in an argument of type \fBstruct
timeval\fP, whereas for the \fIpselect\fP() function the timeout period
is given in seconds and nanoseconds in an argument of
type \fBstruct timespec\fP.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
The \fIselect\fP() function has no \fIsigmask\fP argument; it shall
behave as \fIpselect\fP() does when \fIsigmask\fP is a
null pointer.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
Upon successful completion, the \fIselect\fP() function may modify
the object pointed to by the \fItimeout\fP argument.
.LP
.LP
The \fIpselect\fP() and \fIselect\fP() functions shall support regular
files, terminal and pseudo-terminal devices,  
\ STREAMS-based files,  FIFOs, pipes, and sockets. The behavior
of \fIpselect\fP() and \fIselect\fP() on file descriptors that refer
to other types of file is unspecified.
.LP
The \fInfds\fP argument specifies the range of descriptors to be tested.
The first \fInfds\fP descriptors shall be checked in
each set; that is, the descriptors from zero through \fInfds\fP-1
in the descriptor sets shall be examined.
.LP
If the \fIreadfds\fP argument is not a null pointer, it points to
an object of type \fBfd_set\fP that on input specifies the
file descriptors to be checked for being ready to read, and on output
indicates which file descriptors are ready to read.
.LP
If the \fIwritefds\fP argument is not a null pointer, it points to
an object of type \fBfd_set\fP that on input specifies the
file descriptors to be checked for being ready to write, and on output
indicates which file descriptors are ready to write.
.LP
If the \fIerrorfds\fP argument is not a null pointer, it points to
an object of type \fBfd_set\fP that on input specifies the
file descriptors to be checked for error conditions pending, and on
output indicates which file descriptors have error conditions
pending.
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIpselect\fP() or \fIselect\fP()
function shall modify the objects pointed to by the
\fIreadfds\fP, \fIwritefds\fP, and \fIerrorfds\fP arguments to indicate
which file descriptors are ready for reading, ready for
writing, or have an error condition pending, respectively, and shall
return the total number of ready descriptors in all the output
sets. For each file descriptor less than \fInfds\fP, the corresponding
bit shall be set on successful completion if it was set on
input and the associated condition is true for that file descriptor.
.LP
If none of the selected descriptors are ready for the requested operation,
the \fIpselect\fP() or \fIselect\fP() function
shall block until at least one of the requested operations becomes
ready, until the \fItimeout\fP occurs, or until interrupted by
a signal. The \fItimeout\fP parameter controls how long the \fIpselect\fP()
or \fIselect\fP() function shall take before timing
out. If the \fItimeout\fP parameter is not a null pointer, it specifies
a maximum interval to wait for the selection to complete.
If the specified time interval expires without any requested operation
becoming ready, the function shall return. If the
\fItimeout\fP parameter is a null pointer, then the call to \fIpselect\fP()
or \fIselect\fP() shall block indefinitely until at
least one descriptor meets the specified criteria. To effect a poll,
the \fItimeout\fP parameter should not be a null pointer, and
should point to a zero-valued \fBtimespec\fP structure.
.LP
The use of a timeout does not affect any pending timers set up by
\fIalarm\fP(), \fIualarm\fP(), or \fIsetitimer\fP().
.LP
Implementations may place limitations on the maximum timeout interval
supported. All implementations shall support a maximum
timeout interval of at least 31 days. If the \fItimeout\fP argument
specifies a timeout interval greater than the
implementation-defined maximum value, the maximum value shall be used
as the actual timeout value. Implementations may also place
limitations on the granularity of timeout intervals. If the requested
timeout interval requires a finer granularity than the
implementation supports, the actual timeout interval shall be rounded
up to the next supported value.
.LP
If \fIsigmask\fP is not a null pointer, then the \fIpselect\fP() function
shall replace the signal mask of the process by the
set of signals pointed to by \fIsigmask\fP before examining the descriptors,
and shall restore the signal mask of the process
before returning.
.LP
A descriptor shall be considered ready for reading when a call to
an input function with O_NONBLOCK clear would not block,
whether or not the function would transfer data successfully. (The
function might return data, an end-of-file indication, or an
error other than one indicating that it is blocked, and in each of
these cases the descriptor shall be considered ready for
reading.)
.LP
A descriptor shall be considered ready for writing when a call to
an output function with O_NONBLOCK clear would not block,
whether or not the function would transfer data successfully.
.LP
If a socket has a pending error, it shall be considered to have an
exceptional condition pending. Otherwise, what constitutes an
exceptional condition is file type-specific. For a file descriptor
for use with a socket, it is protocol-specific except as noted
below. For other file types it is implementation-defined. If the operation
is meaningless for a particular file type,
\fIpselect\fP() or \fIselect\fP() shall indicate that the descriptor
is ready for read or write operations, and shall indicate
that the descriptor has no exceptional condition pending.
.LP
If a descriptor refers to a socket, the implied input function is
the \fIrecvmsg\fP()
function with parameters requesting normal and ancillary data, such
that the presence of either type shall cause the socket to be
marked as readable. The presence of out-of-band data shall be checked
if the socket option SO_OOBINLINE has been enabled, as
out-of-band data is enqueued with normal data. If the socket is currently
listening, then it shall be marked as readable if an
incoming connection request has been received, and a call to the \fIaccept\fP()
function
shall complete without blocking.
.LP
If a descriptor refers to a socket, the implied output function is
the \fIsendmsg\fP()
function supplying an amount of normal data equal to the current value
of the SO_SNDLOWAT option for the socket. If a non-blocking
call to the \fIconnect\fP() function has been made for a socket, and
the connection
attempt has either succeeded or failed leaving a pending error, the
socket shall be marked as writable.
.LP
A socket shall be considered to have an exceptional condition pending
if a receive operation with O_NONBLOCK clear for the open
file description and with the MSG_OOB flag set would return out-of-band
data without blocking. (It is protocol-specific whether the
MSG_OOB flag would be used to read out-of-band data.) A socket shall
also be considered to have an exceptional condition pending if
an out-of-band data mark is present in the receive queue. Other circumstances
under which a socket may be considered to have an
exceptional condition pending are protocol-specific and implementation-defined.
.LP
If the \fIreadfds\fP, \fIwritefds\fP, and \fIerrorfds\fP arguments
are all null pointers and the \fItimeout\fP argument is
not a null pointer, the \fIpselect\fP() or \fIselect\fP() function
shall block for the time specified, or until interrupted by a
signal. If the \fIreadfds\fP, \fIwritefds\fP, and \fIerrorfds\fP arguments
are all null pointers and the \fItimeout\fP argument
is a null pointer, the \fIpselect\fP() or \fIselect\fP() function
shall block until interrupted by a signal.
.LP
File descriptors associated with regular files shall always select
true for ready to read, ready to write, and error
conditions.
.LP
On failure, the objects pointed to by the \fIreadfds\fP, \fIwritefds\fP,
and \fIerrorfds\fP arguments shall not be modified.
If the timeout interval expires without the specified condition being
true for any of the specified file descriptors, the objects
pointed to by the \fIreadfds\fP, \fIwritefds\fP, and \fIerrorfds\fP
arguments shall have all bits set to 0.
.LP
File descriptor masks of type \fBfd_set\fP can be initialized and
tested with \fIFD_CLR\fP(), \fIFD_ISSET\fP(),
\fIFD_SET\fP(), and \fIFD_ZERO\fP(). It is unspecified whether each
of these is a macro or a function. If a macro definition is
suppressed in order to access an actual function, or a program defines
an external identifier with any of these names, the behavior
is undefined.
.LP
\fIFD_CLR\fP(\fIfd\fP, \fIfdsetp\fP) shall remove the file descriptor
\fIfd\fP from the set pointed to by \fIfdsetp\fP. If
\fIfd\fP is not a member of this set, there shall be no effect on
the set, nor will an error be returned.
.LP
\fIFD_ISSET\fP(\fIfd\fP, \fIfdsetp\fP) shall evaluate to non-zero
if the file descriptor \fIfd\fP is a member of the set
pointed to by \fIfdsetp\fP, and shall evaluate to zero otherwise.
.LP
\fIFD_SET\fP(\fIfd\fP, \fIfdsetp\fP) shall add the file descriptor
\fIfd\fP to the set pointed to by \fIfdsetp\fP. If the
file descriptor \fIfd\fP is already in this set, there shall be no
effect on the set, nor will an error be returned.
.LP
\fIFD_ZERO\fP(\fIfdsetp\fP) shall initialize the descriptor set pointed
to by \fIfdsetp\fP to the null set. No error is
returned if the set is not empty at the time \fIFD_ZERO\fP() is invoked.
.LP
The behavior of these macros is undefined if the \fIfd\fP argument
is less than 0 or greater than or equal to FD_SETSIZE, or if
\fIfd\fP is not a valid file descriptor, or if any of the arguments
are expressions with side effects.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIpselect\fP() and \fIselect\fP()
functions shall return the total number of bits set in the
bit masks. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, and \fIerrno\fP shall
be set to indicate the error.
.LP
\fIFD_CLR\fP(), \fIFD_SET\fP(), and \fIFD_ZERO\fP() do not return
a value. \fIFD_ISSET\fP() shall return a non-zero value if
the bit for the file descriptor \fIfd\fP is set in the file descriptor
set pointed to by \fIfdset\fP, and 0 otherwise.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
Under the following conditions, \fIpselect\fP() and \fIselect\fP()
shall fail and set \fIerrno\fP to:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
One or more of the file descriptor sets specified a file descriptor
that is not a valid open file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B EINTR
The function was interrupted before any of the selected events occurred
and before the timeout interval expired. 
.LP
If SA_RESTART has been set for the interrupting signal, it is implementation-defined
whether the function restarts or returns with
[EINTR]. 
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
An invalid timeout interval was specified.
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fInfds\fP argument is less than 0 or greater than FD_SETSIZE.
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
One of the specified file descriptors refers to a STREAM or multiplexer
that is linked (directly or indirectly) downstream from a
multiplexer.

.SH EXAMPLES

.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
In previous versions of the Single UNIX Specification, the \fIselect\fP()
function was defined in the \fI<sys/time.h>\fP header. This is now
changed to \fI<sys/select.h>\fP. The rationale for this change was
as follows: the introduction of
the \fIpselect\fP() function included the \fI<sys/select.h>\fP header
and the
\fI<sys/select.h>\fP header defines all the related definitions for
the
\fIpselect\fP() and \fIselect\fP() functions. Backwards-compatibility
to existing XSI implementations is handled by allowing \fI<sys/time.h>\fP
to include \fI<sys/select.h>\fP.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
