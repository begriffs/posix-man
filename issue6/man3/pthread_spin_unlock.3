.SH NAME
pthread_spin_unlock \- unlock a spin lock object (\fBADVANCED REALTIME

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIpthread_spin_unlock\fP() function shall release the spin lock
referenced by \fIlock\fP which was locked via the \fIpthread_spin_lock\fP()
or \fIpthread_spin_trylock\fP() functions. The results are undefined
if the lock is not
held by the calling thread. If there are threads spinning on the lock
when \fIpthread_spin_unlock\fP() is called, the lock becomes
available and an unspecified spinning thread shall acquire the lock.
.LP
The results are undefined if this function is called with an uninitialized
thread spin lock.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIpthread_spin_unlock\fP() function
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
