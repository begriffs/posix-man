.SH NAME
pause \- suspend the thread until a signal is received
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <unistd.h>
.br
.sp
int pause(void);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIpause\fP() function shall suspend the calling thread until
delivery of a signal whose action is either to execute a
signal-catching function or to terminate the process.
.LP
If the action is to terminate the process, \fIpause\fP() shall not
return.
.LP
If the action is to execute a signal-catching function, \fIpause\fP()
shall return after the signal-catching function
returns.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Since \fIpause\fP() suspends thread execution indefinitely unless
interrupted by a signal, there is no successful completion
return value. A value of -1 shall be returned and \fIerrno\fP set
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIpause\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINTR
A signal is caught by the calling process and control is returned
from the signal-catching function.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Many common uses of \fIpause\fP() have timing windows. The scenario
involves checking a condition related to a signal and, if
the signal has not occurred, calling \fIpause\fP(). When the signal
occurs between the check and the call to \fIpause\fP(), the
process often blocks indefinitely. The \fIsigprocmask\fP() and \fIsigsuspend\fP()
functions can be used to avoid this type of problem.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
