.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgetgrgid\fP() function shall search the group database for
an entry with a matching \fIgid\fP.
.LP
The \fIgetgrgid\fP() function need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.
.LP
The \fIgetgrgid_r\fP() function shall update the \fBgroup\fP structure
pointed to by \fIgrp\fP and store a pointer to that
structure at the location pointed to by \fIresult\fP. The structure
shall contain an entry from the group database with a matching
\fIgid\fP. Storage referenced by the group structure is allocated
from the memory provided with the \fIbuffer\fP parameter, which
is \fIbufsize\fP bytes in size. The maximum size needed for this buffer
can be determined with the {_SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX} \fIsysconf\fP()
parameter. A NULL pointer shall be returned at the location pointed
to by
\fIresult\fP on error or if the requested entry is not found. 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIgetgrgid\fP() shall return a pointer
to a \fBstruct group\fP with the structure defined in \fI<grp.h>\fP
with a matching entry if one is found. The \fIgetgrgid\fP() function
shall
return a null pointer if either the requested entry was not found,
or an error occurred. On error, \fIerrno\fP shall be set to
indicate the error.
.LP
The return value may point to a static area which is overwritten by
a subsequent call to \fIgetgrent\fP(), \fIgetgrgid\fP(), or \fIgetgrnam\fP().
.LP
If successful, the \fIgetgrgid_r\fP() function shall return zero;
otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
error. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIgetgrgid\fP() and \fIgetgrgid_r\fP() functions may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EIO
An I/O error has occurred.
.TP 7
.B EINTR
A signal was caught during \fIgetgrgid\fP().
.TP 7
.B EMFILE
{OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in the calling process.
.TP 7
.B ENFILE
The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.
.sp
.LP
The \fIgetgrgid_r\fP() function may fail if: 
.TP 7
.B ERANGE
Insufficient storage was supplied via \fIbuffer\fP and \fIbufsize\fP
to contain the data to be referenced by the resulting
\fBgroup\fP structure.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Finding an Entry in the Group Database
.LP
The following example uses \fIgetgrgid\fP() to search the group database
for a group ID that was previously stored in a
\fBstat\fP structure, then prints out the group name if it is found.
If the group is not found, the program prints the numeric
value of the group for the entry.

.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Applications wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to 0 before calling \fIgetgrgid\fP(). If
\fIerrno\fP is set on return, an error occurred.
.LP
The \fIgetgrgid_r\fP() function is thread-safe and shall return values
in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a
static data area that may be overwritten by each call.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
