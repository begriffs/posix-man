.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwmemset\fP() function shall copy the value of \fIwc\fP into
each of the first \fIn\fP wide characters of the object
pointed to by \fIws\fP. This function shall not be affected by locale
and all \fBwchar_t\fP values shall be treated identically.
The null wide character and \fBwchar_t\fP values not corresponding
to valid characters shall not be treated specially.
.LP
If \fIn\fP is zero, the application shall ensure that \fIws\fP is
a valid pointer, and the function shall copy zero wide
characters.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwmemset\fP() functions shall return the value of \fIws\fP.
.SH ERRORS
