.SH NAME
sockatmark \- determine whether a socket is at the out-of-band mark
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/socket.h>
.br
.sp
int sockatmark(int\fP \fIs\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIsockatmark\fP() function shall determine whether the socket
specified by the descriptor \fIs\fP is at the out-of-band
data mark (see the System Interfaces volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001,
Section 2.10.12, Socket Out-of-Band State). If the protocol for the
socket
supports out-of-band data by marking the stream with an out-of-band
data mark, the \fIsockatmark\fP() function shall return 1 when
all data preceding the mark has been read and the out-of-band data
mark is the first element in the receive queue. The
\fIsockatmark\fP() function shall not remove the mark from the stream.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIsockatmark\fP() function shall
return a value indicating whether the socket is at an
out-of-band data mark. If the protocol has marked the data stream
and all data preceding the mark has been read, the return value
shall be 1; if there is no mark, or if data precedes the mark in the
receive queue, the \fIsockatmark\fP() function shall return
0. Otherwise, it shall return a value of -1 and set \fIerrno\fP to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIsockatmark\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIs\fP argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B ENOTTY
The \fIs\fP argument does not specify a descriptor for a socket.

.SH EXAMPLES

None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The use of this function between receive operations allows an application
to determine which received data precedes the
out-of-band data and which follows the out-of-band data.
.LP
There is an inherent race condition in the use of this function. On
an empty receive queue, the current read of the location
might well be at the "mark", but the system has no way of knowing
that the next data segment that will arrive from the network
will carry the mark, and \fIsockatmark\fP() will return false, and
the next read operation will silently consume the mark.
.LP
Hence, this function can only be used reliably when the application
already knows that the out-of-band data has been seen by the
system or that it is known that there is data waiting to be read at
the socket (via SIGURG or \fIselect\fP()). See \fISocket Receive Queue\fP,
\fISocket Out-of-Band Data State\fP, \fISignals\fP, and \fIpselect\fP()
for
details.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fIsockatmark\fP() function replaces the historical SIOCATMARK
command to \fIioctl\fP() which implemented the same functionality
on many implementations. Using a wrapper
function follows the adopted conventions to avoid specifying commands
to the \fIioctl\fP()
function, other than those now included to support XSI STREAMS. The
\fIsockatmark\fP() function could be implemented as
follows:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB#include <sys/ioctl.h>
.sp

int sockatmark(int s)
{
    int val;
    if (ioctl(s,SIOCATMARK,&val)==-1)
        return(-1);
    return(val);
}
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The use of [ENOTTY] to indicate an incorrect descriptor type matches
the historical behavior of SIOCATMARK.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
