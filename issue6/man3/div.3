.SH NAME
div \- compute the quotient and remainder of an integer division
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdlib.h>
.br
.sp
div_t div(int\fP \fInumer\fP\fB, int\fP \fIdenom\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIdiv\fP() function shall compute the quotient and remainder
of the division of the numerator \fInumer\fP by the
denominator \fIdenom\fP. If the division is inexact, the resulting
quotient is the integer of lesser magnitude that is the nearest
to the algebraic quotient. If the result cannot be represented, the
behavior is undefined; otherwise, \fIquot\fP* \fIdenom\fP+
\fIrem\fP shall equal \fInumer\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIdiv\fP() function shall return a structure of type \fBdiv_t\fP,
comprising both the quotient and the remainder. The
structure includes the following members, in any order:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBint  quot;  /* quotient */
int  rem;   /* remainder */
\fP
.fi
