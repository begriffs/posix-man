.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIpthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling\fP() and \fIpthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling\fP()
functions, respectively, shall get
and set the priority ceiling attribute of a mutex attributes object
pointed to by \fIattr\fP which was previously created by the
function \fIpthread_mutexattr_init\fP().
.LP
The \fIprioceiling\fP attribute contains the priority ceiling of initialized
mutexes. The values of \fIprioceiling\fP are
within the maximum range of priorities defined by SCHED_FIFO.
.LP
The \fIprioceiling\fP attribute defines the priority ceiling of initialized
mutexes, which is the minimum priority level at
which the critical section guarded by the mutex is executed. In order
to avoid priority inversion, the priority ceiling of the
mutex shall be set to a priority higher than or equal to the highest
priority of all the threads that may lock that mutex. The
values of \fIprioceiling\fP are within the maximum range of priorities
defined under the SCHED_FIFO scheduling policy.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIpthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling\fP()
and \fIpthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling\fP()
functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIpthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling\fP() and \fIpthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling\fP()
functions may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value specified by \fIattr\fP or \fIprioceiling\fP is invalid.
.TP 7
.B EPERM
The caller does not have the privilege to perform the operation.
.sp
.LP
These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
