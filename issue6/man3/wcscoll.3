.SH NAME
wcscoll \- wide-character string comparison using collating information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <wchar.h>
.br
.sp
int wcscoll(const wchar_t *\fP\fIws1\fP\fB, const wchar_t *\fP\fIws2\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwcscoll\fP() function shall compare the wide-character string
pointed to by \fIws1\fP to the wide-character string
pointed to by \fIws2\fP, both interpreted as appropriate to the \fILC_COLLATE\fP
category of the current locale.
.LP
The
\fIwcscoll\fP() function shall not change the setting of \fIerrno\fP
if successful.
.LP
An application wishing to check for error situations should set \fIerrno\fP
to 0 before calling \fIwcscoll\fP(). If
\fIerrno\fP is non-zero on return, an error has occurred. 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIwcscoll\fP() shall return an integer
greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according to
whether the wide-character string pointed to by \fIws1\fP is greater
than, equal to, or less than the wide-character string
pointed to by \fIws2\fP, when both are interpreted as appropriate
to the current locale.  On error,
\fIwcscoll\fP() shall set \fIerrno\fP, but no return value is reserved
to indicate an error. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIwcscoll\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIws1\fP or \fIws2\fP arguments contain wide-character codes
outside the domain of the collating sequence.

.SH EXAMPLES

None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIwcsxfrm\fP() and \fIwcscmp\fP()
functions should be used for sorting large lists.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
