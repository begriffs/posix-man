.SH NAME
pthread_equal \- compare thread IDs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <pthread.h>
.br
.sp
int pthread_equal(pthread_t\fP \fIt1\fP\fB, pthread_t\fP \fIt2\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This function shall compare the thread IDs \fIt1\fP and \fIt2\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIpthread_equal\fP() function shall return a non-zero value if
\fIt1\fP and \fIt2\fP are equal; otherwise, zero shall be
returned.
.LP
If either \fIt1\fP or \fIt2\fP are not valid thread IDs, the behavior
is undefined.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
The \fIpthread_equal\fP() function shall not return an error code
of [EINTR].
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Implementations may choose to define a thread ID as a structure. This
allows additional flexibility and robustness over using an
\fBint\fP. For example, a thread ID could include a sequence number
that allows detection of "dangling IDs" (copies of a thread
ID that has been detached). Since the C language does not support
comparison on structure types, the \fIpthread_equal\fP()
function is provided to compare thread IDs.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
