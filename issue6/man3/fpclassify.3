.SH NAME
fpclassify \- classify real floating type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <math.h>
.br
.sp
int fpclassify(real-floating\fP \fIx\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfpclassify\fP() macro shall classify its argument value as
NaN, infinite, normal, subnormal, zero, or into another
implementation-defined category. First, an argument represented in
a format wider than its semantic type is converted to its
semantic type. Then classification is based on the type of the argument.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIfpclassify\fP() macro shall return the value of the number
classification macro appropriate to the value of its
argument.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
