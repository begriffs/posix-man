.SH NAME
posix_trace_attr_destroy, posix_trace_attr_init \- destroy and initialize
the trace stream attributes object
(\fBTRACING\fP)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIposix_trace_attr_destroy\fP() function shall destroy an initialized
trace attributes object. A destroyed \fIattr\fP
attributes object can be reinitialized using \fIposix_trace_attr_init\fP();
the results of otherwise referencing the object after
it has been destroyed are undefined.
.LP
The \fIposix_trace_attr_init\fP() function shall initialize a trace
attributes object \fIattr\fP with the default value for
all of the individual attributes used by a given implementation. The
read-only \fIgeneration-version\fP and
\fIclock-resolution\fP attributes of the newly initialized trace attributes
object shall be set to their appropriate values (see
\fITrace Stream Attributes\fP ).
.LP
Results are undefined if \fIposix_trace_attr_init\fP() is called specifying
an already initialized \fIattr\fP attributes
object.
.LP
Implementations may add extensions to the trace attributes object
structure as permitted in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Chapter 2, Conformance.
.LP
The resulting attributes object (possibly modified by setting individual
attributes values), when used by \fIposix_trace_create\fP(), defines
the attributes of the trace stream created. A
single attributes object can be used in multiple calls to \fIposix_trace_create\fP().
After one or more trace streams have been created using an
attributes object, any function affecting that attributes object,
including destruction, shall not affect any trace stream
previously created. An initialized attributes object also serves to
receive the attributes of an existing trace stream or trace log
when calling the \fIposix_trace_get_attr\fP() function.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value of
zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error
number.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIposix_trace_attr_destroy\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of \fIattr\fP is invalid.
.sp
.LP
The \fIposix_trace_attr_init\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient memory exists to initialize the trace attributes object.
