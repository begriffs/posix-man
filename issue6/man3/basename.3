.SH NAME
basename \- return the last component of a pathname
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <libgen.h>
.br
.sp
char *basename(char *\fP\fIpath\fP\fB); \fP
\fB
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIbasename\fP() function shall take the pathname pointed to by
\fIpath\fP and return a pointer to the final component of
the pathname, deleting any trailing \fB'/'\fP characters.
.LP
If the string consists entirely of the \fB'/'\fP character, \fIbasename\fP()
shall return a pointer to the string
\fB"/"\fP . If the string is exactly \fB"//"\fP, it is implementation-defined
whether \fB'/'\fP or \fB"//"\fP is
returned.
.LP
If \fIpath\fP is a null pointer or points to an empty string, \fIbasename\fP()
shall return a pointer to the string
\fB"."\fP .
.LP
The \fIbasename\fP() function may modify the string pointed to by
\fIpath\fP, and may return a pointer to static storage that
may then be overwritten by a subsequent call to \fIbasename\fP().
.LP
The \fIbasename\fP() function need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIbasename\fP() function shall return a pointer to the final
component of \fIpath\fP.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
