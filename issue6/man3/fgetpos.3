.SH NAME
fgetpos \- get current file position information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
int fgetpos(FILE *restrict\fP \fIstream\fP\fB, fpos_t *restrict\fP
\fIpos\fP\fB);
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfgetpos\fP() function shall store the current values of the
parse state (if any) and file position indicator for the
stream pointed to by \fIstream\fP in the object pointed to by \fIpos\fP.
The value stored contains unspecified information usable
by \fIfsetpos\fP() for repositioning the stream to its position at
the time of the call to
\fIfgetpos\fP().
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIfgetpos\fP() shall return 0; otherwise,
it shall return a non-zero value and set \fIerrno\fP to
indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIfgetpos\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EOVERFLOW
The current value of the file position cannot be represented correctly
in an object of type \fBfpos_t\fP. 
.sp
.LP
The \fIfgetpos\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fP is not valid. 
.TP 7
.B ESPIPE
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fP is associated with a pipe,
FIFO, or socket.
