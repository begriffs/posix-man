.SH NAME
ungetc \- push byte back into input stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
int ungetc(int\fP \fIc\fP\fB, FILE *\fP\fIstream\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIungetc\fP() function shall push the byte specified by \fIc\fP
(converted to an \fBunsigned char\fP) back onto the
input stream pointed to by \fIstream\fP. The pushed-back bytes shall
be returned by subsequent reads on that stream in the reverse
order of their pushing. A successful intervening call (with the stream
pointed to by \fIstream\fP) to a file-positioning function
( \fIfseek\fP(), \fIfsetpos\fP(), or \fIrewind\fP()) shall discard
any pushed-back bytes for the stream. The external storage
corresponding to the stream shall be unchanged.
.LP
One byte of push-back shall be provided. If \fIungetc\fP() is called
too many times on the same stream without an intervening
read or file-positioning operation on that stream, the operation may
fail.
.LP
If the value of \fIc\fP equals that of the macro EOF, the operation
shall fail and the input stream shall be left
unchanged.
.LP
A successful call to \fIungetc\fP() shall clear the end-of-file indicator
for the stream. The value of the file-position
indicator for the stream after reading or discarding all pushed-back
bytes shall be the same as it was before the bytes were pushed
back. The file-position indicator is decremented by each successful
call to \fIungetc\fP(); if its value was 0 before a call, its
value is unspecified after the call.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIungetc\fP() shall return the byte pushed
back after conversion. Otherwise, it shall return
EOF.
