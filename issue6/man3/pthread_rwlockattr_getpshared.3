.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIpthread_rwlockattr_getpshared\fP() function shall obtain the
value of the \fIprocess-shared\fP attribute from the
initialized attributes object referenced by \fIattr\fP. The \fIpthread_rwlockattr_setpshared\fP()
function shall set the
\fIprocess-shared\fP attribute in an initialized attributes object
referenced by \fIattr\fP.
.LP
The \fIprocess-shared\fP attribute shall be set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
to permit a read-write lock to be operated upon by
any thread that has access to the memory where the read-write lock
is allocated, even if the read-write lock is allocated in memory
that is shared by multiple processes. If the \fIprocess-shared\fP
attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the read-write lock shall
only be operated upon by threads created within the same process as
the thread that initialized the read-write lock; if threads of
differing processes attempt to operate on such a read-write lock,
the behavior is undefined. The default value of the
\fIprocess-shared\fP attribute shall be PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.
.LP
Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the
associated functions to get and set those attribute values are
implementation-defined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIpthread_rwlockattr_getpshared\fP()
function shall return zero and store the value of the
\fIprocess-shared\fP attribute of \fIattr\fP into the object referenced
by the \fIpshared\fP parameter. Otherwise, an error
number shall be returned to indicate the error.
.LP
If successful, the \fIpthread_rwlockattr_setpshared\fP() function
shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIpthread_rwlockattr_getpshared\fP() and \fIpthread_rwlockattr_setpshared\fP()
functions may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value specified by \fIattr\fP is invalid.
.sp
.LP
The \fIpthread_rwlockattr_setpshared\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The new value specified for the attribute is outside the range of
legal values for that attribute.
.sp
.LP
These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
