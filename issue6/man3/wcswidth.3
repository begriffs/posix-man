.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwcswidth\fP() function shall determine the number of column
positions required for \fIn\fP wide-character codes (or
fewer than \fIn\fP wide-character codes if a null wide-character code
is encountered before \fIn\fP wide-character codes are
exhausted) in the string pointed to by \fIpwcs\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwcswidth\fP() function either shall return 0 (if \fIpwcs\fP
points to a null wide-character code), or return the number
of column positions to be occupied by the wide-character string pointed
to by \fIpwcs\fP, or return -1 (if any of the first
\fIn\fP wide-character codes in the wide-character string pointed
to by \fIpwcs\fP is not a printable wide-character code).
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
