.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIshutdown\fP() function shall cause all or part of a full-duplex
connection on the socket associated with the file
descriptor \fIsocket\fP to be shut down.
.LP
The \fIshutdown\fP() function takes the following arguments:
.TP 7
\fIsocket\fP
Specifies the file descriptor of the socket.
.TP 7
\fIhow\fP
Specifies the type of shutdown. The values are as follows: 
.TP 7
SHUT_RD
.RS
Disables further receive operations.
.RE
.TP 7
SHUT_WR
.RS
Disables further send operations.
.RE
.TP 7
SHUT_RDWR
.RS
Disables further send and receive operations.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The \fIshutdown\fP() function disables subsequent send and/or receive
operations on a socket, depending on the value of the
\fIhow\fP argument.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIshutdown\fP() shall return 0; otherwise,
-1 shall be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate
the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIshutdown\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIsocket\fP argument is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIhow\fP argument is invalid.
.TP 7
.B ENOTCONN
The socket is not connected.
.TP 7
.B ENOTSOCK
The \fIsocket\fP argument does not refer to a socket.
.sp
.LP
The \fIshutdown\fP() function may fail if:
