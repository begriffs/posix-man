.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <netdb.h> \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This method of returning errors is used only in connection with obsolescent
functions.
.LP
The \fI<netdb.h>\fP header provides a declaration of \fIh_errno\fP
as a
modifiable lvalue of type \fBint\fP.
.LP
It is unspecified whether \fIh_errno\fP is a macro or an identifier
declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is
suppressed in order to access an actual object, or a program defines
an identifier with the name \fIh_errno\fP, the behavior is
undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
None.
.SH ERRORS
.LP

inclusion of the \fI<netdb.h>\fP header.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
\fIh_errno\fP may be withdrawn in a future version.
