.SH NAME
setbuf \- assign buffering to a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
void setbuf(FILE *restrict\fP \fIstream\fP\fB, char *restrict\fP \fIbuf\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Except that it returns no value, the function call:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsetbuf(stream, buf)
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
shall be equivalent to:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsetvbuf(stream, buf, _IOFBF, BUFSIZ)
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
if \fIbuf\fP is not a null pointer, or to:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsetvbuf(stream, buf, _IONBF, BUFSIZ)
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
if \fIbuf\fP is a null pointer.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIsetbuf\fP() function shall not return a value.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
A common source of error is allocating buffer space as an "automatic"
variable in a code block, and then failing to close the
stream in the same block.
.LP
With \fIsetbuf\fP(), allocating a buffer of BUFSIZ bytes does not
necessarily imply that all of BUFSIZ bytes are used for the
buffer area.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
