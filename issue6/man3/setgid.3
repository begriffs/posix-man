.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
If the process has appropriate privileges, \fIsetgid\fP() shall set
the real group ID, effective group ID, and the saved
set-group-ID of the calling process to \fIgid\fP.
.LP
If the process does not have appropriate privileges, but \fIgid\fP
is equal to the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID,
\fIsetgid\fP() shall set the effective group ID to \fIgid\fP; the
real group ID and saved set-group-ID shall remain
unchanged.
.LP
The \fIsetgid\fP() function shall not affect the supplementary group
list in any way.
.LP
Any supplementary group IDs of the calling process shall remain unchanged.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 is returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be
returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS

The value of the \fIgid\fP argument is invalid and is not supported
