.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2\fP() function shall add a
\fIdup2\fP() action to
the object referenced by \fIfile_actions\fP that shall cause the file
descriptor \fIfildes\fP to be duplicated as
\fInewfildes\fP (as if \fIdup2\fP( \fIfildes\fP, \fInewfildes\fP)
had been called) when a new process is spawned using this
file actions object.
.LP
A spawn file actions object is as defined in \fIposix_spawn_file_actions_addclose\fP()
\&.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2\fP()
function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number
shall be returned to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The value specified by \fIfildes\fP or \fInewfildes\fP is negative
or greater than or equal to {OPEN_MAX}.
.TP 7
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient memory exists to add to the spawn file actions object.
.sp
.LP
The \fIposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value specified by \fIfile_actions\fP is invalid.
.sp
.LP
It shall not be considered an error for the \fIfildes\fP argument
passed to the \fIposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2\fP()
function to specify a file descriptor for which the specified operation
could not be performed at the time of the call. Any such
error will be detected when the associated file actions object is
later used during a \fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
operation.

.SH EXAMPLES

.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The \fIposix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2\fP() function is part of the
Spawn option and need not be provided on all
implementations.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Refer to the RATIONALE in \fIposix_spawn_file_actions_addclose\fP()
\&.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
