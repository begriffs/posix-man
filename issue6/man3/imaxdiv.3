.SH NAME
imaxdiv \- return quotient and remainder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

.sp
imaxdiv_t imaxdiv(intmax_t\fP \fInumer\fP\fB, intmax_t\fP \fIdenom\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIimaxdiv\fP() function shall compute \fInumer\fP\ /\ \fIdenom\fP
and \fInumer\fP\ %\ \fIdenom\fP in a
single operation.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIimaxdiv\fP() function shall return a structure of type \fBimaxdiv_t\fP,
comprising both the quotient and the remainder.
The structure shall contain (in either order) the members \fIquot\fP
(the quotient) and \fIrem\fP (the remainder), each of which
has type \fBintmax_t\fP.
.LP
If either part of the result cannot be represented, the behavior is
undefined.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
