.SH NAME
setreuid \- set real and effective user IDs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <unistd.h>
.br
.sp
int setreuid(uid_t\fP \fIruid\fP\fB, uid_t\fP \fIeuid\fP\fB); \fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIsetreuid\fP() function shall set the real and effective user
IDs of the current process to the values specified by the
\fIruid\fP and \fIeuid\fP arguments. If \fIruid\fP or \fIeuid\fP is
-1, the corresponding effective or real user ID of the
current process shall be left unchanged.
.LP
A process with appropriate privileges can set either ID to any value.
An unprivileged process can only set the effective user ID
if the \fIeuid\fP argument is equal to either the real, effective,
or saved user ID of the process.
.LP
It is unspecified whether a process without appropriate privileges
is permitted to change the real user ID to match the current
real, effective, or saved set-user-ID of the process.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall
be returned and \fIerrno\fP set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIsetreuid\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The value of the \fIruid\fP or \fIeuid\fP argument is invalid or out-of-range.
.TP 7
.B EPERM
The current process does not have appropriate privileges, and either
an attempt was made to change the effective user ID to a
value other than the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID or an attempt
was made to change the real user ID to a value not
permitted by the implementation.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Setting the Effective User ID to the Real User ID
.LP
The following example sets the effective user ID of the calling process
to the real user ID, so that files created later will be
owned by the current user.
