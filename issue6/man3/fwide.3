.SH NAME
fwide \- set stream orientation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
#include <wchar.h>
.br
.sp
int fwide(FILE *\fP\fIstream\fP\fB, int\fP \fImode\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIfwide\fP() function shall determine the orientation of the
stream pointed to by \fIstream\fP. If \fImode\fP is greater
than zero, the function first attempts to make the stream wide-oriented.
If \fImode\fP is less than zero, the function first
attempts to make the stream byte-oriented. Otherwise, \fImode\fP is
zero and the function does not alter the orientation of the
stream.
.LP
If the orientation of the stream has already been determined, \fIfwide\fP()
shall not change it.
.LP
Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an application
wishing to check for error situations should set
\fIerrno\fP to 0, then call \fIfwide\fP(), then check \fIerrno\fP,
and if it is non-zero, assume an error has occurred. 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIfwide\fP() function shall return a value greater than zero
if, after the call, the stream has wide-orientation, a value
less than zero if the stream has byte-orientation, or zero if the
stream has no orientation.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIfwide\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The \fIstream\fP argument is not a valid stream.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
A call to \fIfwide\fP() with \fImode\fP set to zero can be used to
determine the current orientation of a stream.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
