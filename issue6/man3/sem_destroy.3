.SH NAME
sem_destroy \- destroy an unnamed semaphore (\fBREALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <semaphore.h>
.br
.sp
int sem_destroy(sem_t *\fP\fIsem\fP\fB); \fP

\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIsem_destroy\fP() function shall destroy the unnamed semaphore
indicated by \fIsem\fP. Only a semaphore that was created
using \fIsem_init\fP() may be destroyed using \fIsem_destroy\fP();
the effect of calling
\fIsem_destroy\fP() with a named semaphore is undefined. The effect
of subsequent use of the semaphore \fIsem\fP is undefined
until \fIsem\fP is reinitialized by another call to \fIsem_init\fP().
.LP
It is safe to destroy an initialized semaphore upon which no threads
are currently blocked. The effect of destroying a semaphore
upon which other threads are currently blocked is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, a value of zero shall be returned. Otherwise,
a value of -1 shall be returned and \fIerrno\fP set
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIsem_destroy\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIsem\fP argument is not a valid semaphore.
.sp
.LP
The \fIsem_destroy\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBUSY
There are currently processes blocked on the semaphore.

and need not be available on all implementations.
.SH RATIONALE

None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
