.SH NAME
unsetenv \- remove an environment variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdlib.h>
.br
.sp
int unsetenv(const char *\fP\fIname\fP\fB); \fP
\fB

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIunsetenv\fP() function shall remove an environment variable
from the environment of the calling process. The \fIname\fP
argument points to a string, which is the name of the variable to
be removed. The named argument shall not contain an \fB'='\fP
character. If the named variable does not exist in the current environment,
the environment shall be unchanged and the function is
considered to have completed successfully.
.LP
If the application modifies \fIenviron\fP or the pointers to which
it points, the behavior of \fIunsetenv\fP() is undefined.
The \fIunsetenv\fP() function shall update the list of pointers to
which \fIenviron\fP points.
.LP
The \fIunsetenv\fP() function need not be reentrant. A function that
is not required to be reentrant is not required to be
thread-safe.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, zero shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
shall be returned, \fIerrno\fP set to indicate the error, and
the environment shall be unchanged.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIunsetenv\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
The \fIname\fP argument is a null pointer, points to an empty string,
or points to a string containing an \fB'='\fP
character.
