.SH NAME
ftell, ftello \- return a file offset in a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIftell\fP() function shall obtain the current value of the file-position
indicator for the stream pointed to by
\fIstream\fP.
.LP
The
\fIftello\fP() function shall be equivalent to \fIftell\fP(), except
that the return value is of type \fBoff_t\fP. 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIftell\fP()  and \fIftello\fP() 
\ shall return the current value of the file-position indicator for
the stream measured in bytes
from the beginning of the file.
.LP
Otherwise, \fIftell\fP()  and \fIftello\fP()  shall return
-1, cast to \fBlong\fP and \fBoff_t\fP respectively, and set \fIerrno\fP
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIftell\fP()  and \fIftello\fP()  functions
shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EBADF
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fP is not an open file descriptor.
.TP 7
.B EOVERFLOW
For \fIftell\fP(), the current file offset cannot be represented correctly
in an object of type \fBlong\fP. 
.TP 7
.B EOVERFLOW
For \fIftello\fP(), the current file offset cannot be represented
correctly in an object of type \fBoff_t\fP. 
.TP 7
.B ESPIPE
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fP is associated with a pipe
or FIFO. 
.sp
.LP
The \fIftell\fP() function may fail if:
.TP 7
.B ESPIPE
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fP is associated with a socket.
