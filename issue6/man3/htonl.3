.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
These functions shall convert 16-bit and 32-bit quantities between
network byte order and host byte order.
.LP
On some implementations, these functions are defined as macros.
.LP
The \fBuint32_t\fP and \fBuint16_t\fP types are defined in \fI<inttypes.h>\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIhtonl\fP() and \fIhtons\fP() functions shall return the argument
value converted from host to network byte order.
.LP
The \fIntohl\fP() and \fIntohs\fP() functions shall return the argument
value converted from network to host byte order.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
These functions are most often used in conjunction with IPv4 addresses
and ports as returned by \fIgethostent\fP() and \fIgetservent\fP().
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
