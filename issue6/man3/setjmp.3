.SH NAME
setjmp \- set jump point for a non-local goto
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <setjmp.h>
.br
.sp
int setjmp(jmp_buf\fP \fIenv\fP\fB);
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
A call to \fIsetjmp\fP() shall save the calling environment in its
\fIenv\fP argument for later use by \fIlongjmp\fP().
.LP
It is unspecified whether \fIsetjmp\fP() is a macro or a function.
If a macro definition is suppressed in order to access an
actual function, or a program defines an external identifier with
the name \fIsetjmp\fP, the behavior is undefined.
.LP
An application shall ensure that an invocation of \fIsetjmp\fP() appears
in one of the following contexts only:
.IP " *" 3
The entire controlling expression of a selection or iteration statement
.LP
.IP " *" 3
One operand of a relational or equality operator with the other operand
an integral constant expression, with the resulting
expression being the entire controlling expression of a selection
or iteration statement
.LP
.IP " *" 3
The operand of a unary \fB'!'\fP operator with the resulting expression
being the entire controlling expression of a
selection or iteration
.LP
.IP " *" 3
The entire expression of an expression statement (possibly cast to
\fBvoid\fP)
.LP
.LP
If the invocation appears in any other context, the behavior is undefined.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
If the return is from a direct invocation, \fIsetjmp\fP() shall return
0. If the return is from a call to \fIlongjmp\fP(), \fIsetjmp\fP()
shall return a non-zero value.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
In general, \fIsigsetjmp\fP() is more useful in dealing with errors
and interrupts
encountered in a low-level subroutine of a program.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
