.SH NAME
mq_unlink \- remove a message queue (\fBREALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <mqueue.h>
.br
.sp
int mq_unlink(const char *\fP\fIname\fP\fB); \fP
\fB
.br
\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fImq_unlink\fP() function shall remove the message queue named
by the pathname \fIname\fP. After a successful call to
\fImq_unlink\fP() with \fIname\fP, a call to \fImq_open\fP() with
\fIname\fP shall fail
if the flag O_CREAT is not set in \fIflags\fP. If one or more processes
have the message queue open when \fImq_unlink\fP() is
called, destruction of the message queue shall be postponed until
all references to the message queue have been closed.
.LP
Calls to \fImq_open\fP() to recreate the message queue may fail until
the message queue
is actually removed. However, the \fImq_unlink\fP() call need not
block until all references have been closed; it may return
immediately.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the function shall return a value of zero.
Otherwise, the named message queue shall be unchanged by
this function call, and the function shall return a value of -1 and
set \fIerrno\fP to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fImq_unlink\fP() function shall fail if:
.TP 7
.B EACCES
Permission is denied to unlink the named message queue.
.TP 7
.B ENAMETOOLONG
The length of the \fIname\fP argument exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname
component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.
.TP 7
.B ENOENT
The named message queue does not exist.
