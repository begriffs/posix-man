.SH NAME
wmemmove \- copy wide characters in memory with overlapping areas
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <wchar.h>
.br
.sp
wchar_t *wmemmove(wchar_t *\fP\fIws1\fP\fB, const wchar_t *\fP\fIws2\fP\fB,

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIwmemmove\fP() function shall copy \fIn\fP wide characters from
the object pointed to by \fIws2\fP to the object
pointed to by \fIws1\fP. Copying shall take place as if the \fIn\fP
wide characters from the object pointed to by \fIws2\fP are
first copied into a temporary array of \fIn\fP wide characters that
does not overlap the objects pointed to by \fIws1\fP or
\fIws2\fP, and then the \fIn\fP wide characters from the temporary
array are copied into the object pointed to by \fIws1\fP.
.LP
This function shall not be affected by locale and all \fBwchar_t\fP
values shall be treated identically. The null wide
character and \fBwchar_t\fP values not corresponding to valid characters
shall not be treated specially.
.LP
If \fIn\fP is zero, the application shall ensure that \fIws1\fP and
\fIws2\fP are valid pointers, and the function shall copy
zero wide characters.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
The \fIwmemmove\fP() function shall return the value of \fIws1\fP.
