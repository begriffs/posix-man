.SH NAME
sys/uio.h \- definitions for vector I/O operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/uio.h> \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<sys/uio.h>\fP header shall define the \fBiovec\fP structure
that includes at least the following members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBvoid   *iov_base \fP Base address of a memory region for input or output. \fB
size_t  iov_len  \fP The size of the memory pointed to by \fIiov_base.\fP \fB
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The \fI<sys/uio.h>\fP header uses the \fBiovec\fP structure for scatter/gather
I/O.
.LP
The \fBssize_t\fP and \fBsize_t\fP types shall be defined as described
in \fI<sys/types.h>\fP.
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBssize_t readv(int, const struct iovec *, int);
ssize_t writev(int, const struct iovec *, int);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The implementation can put a limit on the number of scatter/gather
elements which can be processed in one call. The symbol
{IOV_MAX} defined in \fI<limits.h>\fP should always be used to learn
about the
limits instead of assuming a fixed value.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Traditionally, the maximum number of scatter/gather elements the system
can process in one call were described by the symbolic
value {UIO_MAXIOV}. In IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 this value is replaced
by the constant {IOV_MAX} which can be found in \fI<limits.h>\fP.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
