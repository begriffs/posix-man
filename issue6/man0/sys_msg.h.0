.SH NAME
sys/msg.h \- XSI message queue structures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/msg.h> \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<sys/msg.h>\fP header shall define the following data types
through \fBtypedef\fP:
.TP 7
\fBmsgqnum_t\fP
Used for the number of messages in the message queue.
.TP 7
\fBmsglen_t\fP
Used for the number of bytes allowed in a message queue.
.sp
.LP
These types shall be unsigned integer types that are able to store
values at least as large as a type \fBunsigned short\fP.
.LP
The \fI<sys/msg.h>\fP header shall define the following constant as
a message operation flag:
.TP 7
MSG_NOERROR
No error if big message.
.sp
.LP
The \fBmsqid_ds\fP structure shall contain the following members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBstruct ipc_perm msg_perm  \fP Operation permission structure. \fB
msgqnum_t       msg_qnum  \fP Number of messages currently on queue. \fB
msglen_t        msg_qbytes\fP Maximum number of bytes allowed on queue. \fB
pid_t           msg_lspid \fP Process ID of last \fImsgsnd\fP
 (). \fB
pid_t           msg_lrpid \fP Process ID of last \fImsgrcv\fP
 (). \fB
time_t          msg_stime \fP Time of last \fImsgsnd\fP
 (). \fB
time_t          msg_rtime \fP Time of last \fImsgrcv\fP
 (). \fB
time_t          msg_ctime \fP Time of last change. \fB
\fP

.LP
The \fBpid_t\fP, \fBtime_t\fP, \fBkey_t\fP, \fBsize_t\fP, and \fBssize_t\fP
types shall be defined as described in \fI<sys/types.h>\fP .
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBint       msgctl(int, int, struct msqid_ds *);
int       msgget(key_t, int);
ssize_t   msgrcv(int, void *, size_t, long, int);
int       msgsnd(int, const void *, size_t, int);
