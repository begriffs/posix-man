.SH NAME
ucontext.h \- user context
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <ucontext.h> \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<ucontext.h>\fP header shall define the \fBmcontext_t\fP type
through \fBtypedef\fP.
.LP
The \fI<ucontext.h>\fP header shall define the \fBucontext_t\fP type
as a structure that shall include at least the
following members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBucontext_t *uc_link    \fP Pointer to the context that is resumed \fB
                       \fP when this context returns. \fB
sigset_t    uc_sigmask \fP The set of signals that are blocked when this \fB
                       \fP context is active. \fB
stack_t     uc_stack   \fP The stack used by this context. \fB
mcontext_t  uc_mcontext\fP A machine-specific representation of the saved \fB
                       \fP context. \fB
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The types \fBsigset_t\fP and \fBstack_t\fP shall be defined as in
\fI<signal.h>\fP .
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros, Function prototypes shall be provided.
