.SH NAME
sys/ipc.h \- XSI interprocess communication access structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/ipc.h> \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<sys/ipc.h>\fP header is used by three mechanisms for XSI interprocess
communication (IPC): messages, semaphores,
and shared memory. All use a common structure type, \fBipc_perm\fP,
to pass information used in determining permission to perform
an IPC operation.
.LP
The \fBipc_perm\fP structure shall contain the following members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBuid_t    uid   \fP Owner's user ID. \fB
gid_t    gid   \fP Owner's group ID. \fB
uid_t    cuid  \fP Creator's user ID. \fB
gid_t    cgid  \fP Creator's group ID. \fB
mode_t   mode  \fP Read/write permission. \fB
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The \fBuid_t\fP, \fBgid_t\fP, \fBmode_t\fP, and \fBkey_t\fP types
shall be defined as described in \fI<sys/types.h>\fP .
.LP
Definitions shall be provided for the following constants:
.LP
Mode bits:
.TP 7
IPC_CREAT
Create entry if key does not exist.
.TP 7
IPC_EXCL
Fail if key exists.
.TP 7
IPC_NOWAIT
Error if request must wait.
.sp
.LP
Keys:
.TP 7
IPC_PRIVATE
Private key.
.sp
.LP
Control commands:
.TP 7
IPC_RMID
Remove identifier.
.TP 7
IPC_SET
Set options.
.TP 7
IPC_STAT
Get options.
.sp
.LP
The following shall be declared as a function and may also be defined
as a macro. A function prototype shall be provided.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBkey_t  ftok(const char *, int);
