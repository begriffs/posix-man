.SH NAME
sys/wait.h \- declarations for waiting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/wait.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<sys/wait.h>\fP header shall define the following symbolic
constants for use with \fIwaitpid\fP():
.TP 7
WNOHANG
Do not hang if no status is available; return immediately.
.TP 7
WUNTRACED
Report status of stopped child process.
.sp
.LP
The \fI<sys/wait.h>\fP header shall define the following macros for
analysis of process status values:
.TP 7
WEXITSTATUS
Return exit status.
.TP 7
WIFCONTINUED
True if child has been continued. 
.TP 7
WIFEXITED
True if child exited normally.
.TP 7
WIFSIGNALED
True if child exited due to uncaught signal.
.TP 7
WIFSTOPPED
True if child is currently stopped.
.TP 7
WSTOPSIG
Return signal number that caused process to stop.
.TP 7
WTERMSIG
Return signal number that caused process to terminate.
.sp
.LP
The following symbolic constants shall be defined as possible values
for the \fIoptions\fP argument to \fIwaitid\fP():
.TP 7
WEXITED
Wait for processes that have exited.
.TP 7
WSTOPPED
Status is returned for any child that has stopped upon receipt of
a signal.
.TP 7
WCONTINUED
Status is returned for any child that was stopped and has been continued.
.TP 7
WNOHANG
Return immediately if there are no children to wait for.
.TP 7
WNOWAIT
Keep the process whose status is returned in \fIinfop\fP in a waitable
state.
.sp
.LP
The type \fBidtype_t\fP shall be defined as an enumeration type whose
possible values shall include at least the following:
P_ALL P_PID P_PGID 
.LP
The \fBid_t\fP and \fBpid_t\fP types shall be defined as described
in \fI<sys/types.h>\fP .
.LP
The \fBsiginfo_t\fP type shall be defined as described in \fI<signal.h>\fP
\&.
.LP
The \fBrusage\fP structure shall be defined as described in \fI<sys/resource.h>\fP
\&.
.LP
Inclusion of the \fI<sys/wait.h>\fP header may also make visible all
symbols from \fI<signal.h>\fP and \fI<sys/resource.h>\fP. 
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
