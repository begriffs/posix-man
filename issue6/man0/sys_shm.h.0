.SH NAME
sys/shm.h \- XSI shared memory facility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/shm.h> \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<sys/shm.h>\fP header shall define the following symbolic constants:
.TP 7
SHM_RDONLY
Attach read-only (else read-write).
.TP 7
SHM_RND
Round attach address to SHMLBA.
.sp
.LP
The \fI<sys/shm.h>\fP header shall define the following symbolic value:
.TP 7
SHMLBA
Segment low boundary address multiple.
.sp
.LP
The following data types shall be defined through \fBtypedef\fP:
.TP 7
\fBshmatt_t\fP
Unsigned integer used for the number of current attaches that must
be able to store values at least as large as a type
\fBunsigned short\fP.
.sp
.LP
The \fBshmid_ds\fP structure shall contain the following members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBstruct ipc_perm shm_perm  \fP Operation permission structure. \fB
size_t          shm_segsz \fP Size of segment in bytes. \fB
pid_t           shm_lpid  \fP Process ID of last shared memory operation. \fB
pid_t           shm_cpid  \fP Process ID of creator. \fB
shmatt_t        shm_nattch\fP Number of current attaches. \fB
time_t          shm_atime \fP Time of last \fIshmat\fP
 (). \fB
time_t          shm_dtime \fP Time of last \fIshmdt\fP
 (). \fB
time_t          shm_ctime \fP Time of last change by \fIshmctl\fP
 (). \fB
\fP

.LP
The \fBpid_t\fP, \fBtime_t\fP, \fBkey_t\fP, and \fBsize_t\fP types
shall be defined as described in \fI<sys/types.h>\fP .
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBvoid *shmat(int, const void *, int);
int   shmctl(int, int, struct shmid_ds *);
int   shmdt(const void *);
int   shmget(key_t, size_t, int);
