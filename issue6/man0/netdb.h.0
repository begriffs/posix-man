.TP 7
AI_NUMERICSERV

.TP 7
AI_V4MAPPED
If no IPv6 addresses are found, query for IPv4 addresses and return
them to the caller as IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
.TP 7
AI_ALL
Query for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
.TP 7
AI_ADDRCONFIG
.sp
Query for IPv4 addresses only when an IPv4 address is configured;
query for IPv6 addresses only when an IPv6 address is
configured.
.sp
.LP
The \fI<netdb.h>\fP header shall define the following macros that

.TP 7
NI_NOFQDN
Only the nodename portion of the FQDN is returned for local hosts.
.TP 7
NI_NUMERICHOST
.sp
The numeric form of the node's address is returned instead of its
name.
.TP 7
NI_NAMEREQD
Return an error if the node's name cannot be located in the database.
.TP 7
NI_NUMERICSERV
.sp
The numeric form of the service address is returned instead of its
name.
.TP 7
NI_NUMERICSCOPE
.sp
For IPv6 addresses, the numeric form of the scope identifier is returned
instead of its name.
.TP 7
NI_DGRAM
Indicates that the service is a datagram service (SOCK_DGRAM).
.sp
.SS Address Information Errors
.LP
The \fI<netdb.h>\fP header shall define the following macros for use
as error values for \fIgetaddrinfo\fP() and \fIgetnameinfo\fP():

EAI_AGAIN
The name could not be resolved at this time. Future attempts may succeed.
.TP 7
EAI_BADFLAGS
The flags had an invalid value.
.TP 7
EAI_FAIL
A non-recoverable error occurred.

EAI_FAMILY
The address family was not recognized or the address length was invalid
for the specified family.
.TP 7
EAI_MEMORY
There was a memory allocation failure.
.TP 7
EAI_NONAME
The name does not resolve for the supplied parameters. 
.LP
NI_NAMEREQD is set and the host's name cannot be located, or both
\fInodename\fP and \fIservname\fP were null.
.TP 7
EAI_SERVICE
The service passed was not recognized for the specified socket type.
.TP 7
EAI_SOCKTYPE
The intended socket type was not recognized.
.TP 7
EAI_SYSTEM
A system error occurred. The error code can be found in \fIerrno\fP.
.TP 7
