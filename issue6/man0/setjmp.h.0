setjmp.h \- stack environment declarations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <setjmp.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Some of the functionality described on this reference page extends
the ISO\ C standard. Applications shall define
the appropriate feature test macro (see the System Interfaces volume
of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 2.2, The Compilation Environment)
to enable the visibility of these symbols in this
header. 
.LP
The \fI<setjmp.h>\fP header shall define the array types \fBjmp_buf\fP
and   \fBsigjmp_buf\fP.
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBvoid   longjmp(jmp_buf, int);

void   siglongjmp(sigjmp_buf, int);


void  _longjmp(jmp_buf, int);
