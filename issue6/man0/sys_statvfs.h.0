.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/statvfs.h> \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<sys/statvfs.h>\fP header shall define the \fBstatvfs\fP structure
that includes at least the following
members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBunsigned long f_bsize   \fP File system block size. \fB
unsigned long f_frsize  \fP Fundamental file system block size. \fB
fsblkcnt_t    f_blocks  \fP Total number of blocks on file system in units of \fIf_frsize.\fP \fB
fsblkcnt_t    f_bfree   \fP Total number of free blocks. \fB
fsblkcnt_t    f_bavail  \fP Number of free blocks available to \fB
                        \fP non-privileged process. \fB
fsfilcnt_t    f_files   \fP Total number of file serial numbers. \fB
fsfilcnt_t    f_ffree   \fP Total number of free file serial numbers. \fB
fsfilcnt_t    f_favail  \fP Number of file serial numbers available to \fB
                        \fP non-privileged process. \fB
unsigned long f_fsid    \fP File system ID. \fB
unsigned long f_flag    \fP Bit mask of \fIf_flag\fP values. \fB
unsigned long f_namemax \fP Maximum filename length. \fB

.RE
.LP
The \fBfsblkcnt_t\fP and \fBfsfilcnt_t\fP types shall be defined as
described in \fI<sys/types.h>\fP .
.LP
The following flags for the \fIf_flag\fP member shall be defined:
.TP 7
ST_RDONLY
Read-only file system.
.TP 7
ST_NOSUID
Does not support the semantics of the ST_ISUID and ST_ISGID file mode
bits.
.sp
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
