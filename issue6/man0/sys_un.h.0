.SH NAME
sys/un.h \- definitions for UNIX domain sockets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/un.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<sys/un.h>\fP header shall define the \fBsockaddr_un\fP structure
that includes at least the following
members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsa_family_t  sun_family \fP Address family. \fB
char         sun_path[] \fP Socket pathname. \fB
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The \fBsockaddr_un\fP structure is used to store addresses for UNIX
domain sockets. Values of this type shall be cast by
applications to \fBstruct sockaddr\fP for use with socket functions.
.LP
The \fBsa_family_t\fP type shall be defined as described in \fI<sys/socket.h>\fP
\&.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The size of \fIsun_path\fP has intentionally been left undefined.
This is because different implementations use different
sizes. For example, 4.3 BSD uses a size of 108, and 4.4 BSD uses a
size of 104. Since most implementations originate from BSD
versions, the size is typically in the range 92 to 108.
.LP
Applications should not assume a particular length for \fIsun_path\fP
or assume that it can hold {_POSIX_PATH_MAX} characters
(255).
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
