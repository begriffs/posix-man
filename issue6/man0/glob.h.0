.SH NAME
glob.h \- pathname pattern-matching types
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <glob.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<glob.h>\fP header shall define the structures and symbolic
constants used by the \fIglob\fP() function.
.LP
The structure type \fBglob_t\fP shall contain at least the following
members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsize_t   gl_pathc\fP Count of paths matched by \fIpattern.\fP \fB
char   **gl_pathv\fP Pointer to a list of matched pathnames. \fB
size_t   gl_offs \fP Slots to reserve at the beginning of \fIgl_pathv.\fP \fB
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The following constants shall be provided as values for the \fIflags\fP
argument:
.TP 7
GLOB_APPEND
Append generated pathnames to those previously obtained.
.TP 7
GLOB_DOOFFS
Specify how many null pointers to add to the beginning of \fIgl_pathv\fP.
.TP 7
GLOB_ERR
Cause \fIglob\fP() to return on error.
.TP 7
GLOB_MARK
Each pathname that is a directory that matches \fIpattern\fP has a
slash appended.
.TP 7
GLOB_NOCHECK
If \fIpattern\fP does not match any pathname, then return a list consisting
of only \fIpattern\fP.
.TP 7
GLOB_NOESCAPE
Disable backslash escaping.
.TP 7
GLOB_NOSORT
Do not sort the pathnames returned.
.sp
.LP
The following constants shall be defined as error return values:
.TP 7
GLOB_ABORTED
The scan was stopped because GLOB_ERR was set or (*\fIerrfunc\fP)()
returned non-zero.
.TP 7
GLOB_NOMATCH
The pattern does not match any existing pathname, and GLOB_NOCHECK
was not set in \fIflags\fP.
.TP 7
GLOB_NOSPACE
An attempt to allocate memory failed.
.TP 7
GLOB_NOSYS
Reserved. 
.sp
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBint  glob(const char *restrict, int, int (*)(const char *, int),
         glob_t *restrict);
void globfree (glob_t *);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The implementation may define additional macros or constants using
names beginning with GLOB_.
