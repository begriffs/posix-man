.SH NAME
wordexp.h \- word-expansion types
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <wordexp.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<wordexp.h>\fP header shall define the structures and symbolic
constants used by the \fIwordexp\fP() and \fIwordfree\fP() functions.
.LP
The structure type \fBwordexp_t\fP shall contain at least the following
members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsize_t   we_wordc \fP Count of words matched by \fIwords.\fP \fB
char   **we_wordv \fP Pointer to list of expanded words. \fB
size_t   we_offs  \fP Slots to reserve at the beginning of \fIwe_wordv.\fP \fB
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The \fIflags\fP argument to the \fIwordexp\fP() function shall be
the
bitwise-inclusive OR of the following flags:
.TP 7
WRDE_APPEND
Append words to those previously generated.
.TP 7
WRDE_DOOFFS
Number of null pointers to prepend to \fIwe_wordv\fP.
.TP 7
WRDE_NOCMD
Fail if command substitution is requested.
.TP 7
WRDE_REUSE
The \fIpwordexp\fP argument was passed to a previous successful call
to \fIwordexp\fP(), and has not been passed to \fIwordfree\fP(). The
result is the same as if the application had called \fIwordfree\fP()
and then called \fIwordexp\fP() without
WRDE_REUSE.
.TP 7
WRDE_SHOWERR
Do not redirect \fIstderr\fP to \fB/dev/null\fP.
.TP 7
WRDE_UNDEF
Report error on an attempt to expand an undefined shell variable.
.sp
.LP
The following constants shall be defined as error return values:
.TP 7
WRDE_BADCHAR
One of the unquoted characters- <newline>, \fB'|'\fP, \fB'&'\fP,
\fB';'\fP, \fB'<'\fP,
\fB'>'\fP, \fB'('\fP, \fB')'\fP, \fB'{'\fP, \fB'}'\fP - appears
in \fIwords\fP in an inappropriate
context.
.TP 7
WRDE_BADVAL
Reference to undefined shell variable when WRDE_UNDEF is set in \fIflags\fP.
.TP 7
WRDE_CMDSUB
Command substitution requested when WRDE_NOCMD was set in \fIflags\fP.
.TP 7
WRDE_NOSPACE
Attempt to allocate memory failed.
.TP 7
WRDE_NOSYS
Reserved. 
.TP 7
WRDE_SYNTAX
Shell syntax error, such as unbalanced parentheses or unterminated
string.
.sp
.LP
The \fI<wordexp.h>\fP header shall define the following type:
.TP 7
\fBsize_t\fP
As described in \fI<stddef.h>\fP . 
.sp
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBint  wordexp(const char *restrict, wordexp_t *restrict, int);
void wordfree(wordexp_t *);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The implementation may define additional macros or constants using
names beginning with WRDE_.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
