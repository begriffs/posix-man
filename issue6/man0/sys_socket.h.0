sys/socket.h \- main sockets header
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/socket.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<sys/socket.h>\fP header shall define the type \fBsocklen_t\fP,
which is an integer type of width of at least 32
bits; see APPLICATION USAGE.
.LP
The \fI<sys/socket.h>\fP header shall define the unsigned integer
type \fBsa_family_t\fP.
.LP
The \fI<sys/socket.h>\fP header shall define the \fBsockaddr\fP structure
that includes at least the following
members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsa_family_t  sa_family \fP Address family. \fB
char         sa_data[] \fP Socket address (variable-length data). \fB
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The \fBsockaddr\fP structure is used to define a socket address which
is used in the \fIbind\fP(), \fIconnect\fP(), \fIgetpeername\fP(),
\fIgetsockname\fP(),
\fIrecvfrom\fP(), and \fIsendto\fP()
functions.
.LP
The \fI<sys/socket.h>\fP header shall define the \fBsockaddr_storage\fP
structure. This structure shall be:
.IP " *" 3
Large enough to accommodate all supported protocol-specific address
structures
.LP
.IP " *" 3
Aligned at an appropriate boundary so that pointers to it can be cast
as pointers to protocol-specific address structures and
used to access the fields of those structures without alignment problems
.LP
.LP
The \fBsockaddr_storage\fP structure shall contain at least the following
members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsa_family_t   ss_family
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
When a \fBsockaddr_storage\fP structure is cast as a \fBsockaddr\fP
structure, the \fIss_family\fP field of the
\fBsockaddr_storage\fP structure shall map onto the \fIsa_family\fP
field of the \fBsockaddr\fP structure. When a
\fBsockaddr_storage\fP structure is cast as a protocol-specific address
structure, the \fIss_family\fP field shall map onto a
field of that structure that is of type \fBsa_family_t\fP and that
identifies the protocol's address family.
.LP
The \fI<sys/socket.h>\fP header shall define the \fBmsghdr\fP structure
that includes at least the following
members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBvoid          *msg_name       \fP Optional address. \fB
socklen_t      msg_namelen    \fP Size of address. \fB

int            msg_flags      \fP Flags on received message. \fB

.LP
The \fBmsghdr\fP structure is used to minimize the number of directly
supplied parameters to the \fIrecvmsg\fP() and \fIsendmsg\fP() functions.
This
structure is used as a \fIvalue\fP- \fIresult\fP parameter in the
\fIrecvmsg\fP()
function and \fIvalue\fP only for the \fIsendmsg\fP() function.
.LP
The \fBiovec\fP structure shall be defined as described in \fI<sys/uio.h>\fP
\&.
.LP
The \fI<sys/socket.h>\fP header shall define the \fBcmsghdr\fP structure
that includes at least the following

.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsocklen_t  cmsg_len   \fP Data byte count, including the \fBcmsghdr\fP. \fB

.LP
The \fBcmsghdr\fP structure is used for storage of ancillary data
object information.
.LP
Ancillary data consists of a sequence of pairs, each consisting of
a \fBcmsghdr\fP structure followed by a data array. The data
array contains the ancillary data message, and the \fBcmsghdr\fP structure
contains descriptive information that allows an
application to correctly parse the data.
.LP
The values for \fIcmsg_level\fP shall be legal values for the \fIlevel\fP
argument to the \fIgetsockopt\fP() and \fIsetsockopt\fP()
functions. The system documentation shall specify the \fIcmsg_type\fP
definitions for the supported protocols.
.LP
Ancillary data is also possible at the socket level. The \fI<sys/socket.h>\fP
header defines the following macro for use
as the \fIcmsg_type\fP value when \fIcmsg_level\fP is SOL_SOCKET:
.TP 7
SCM_RIGHTS
Indicates that the data array contains the access rights to be sent
or received.
.sp
.LP
The \fI<sys/socket.h>\fP header defines the following macros to gain
access to the data arrays in the ancillary data
associated with a message header:
.TP 7
CMSG_DATA(\fIcmsg\fP)
.sp
If the argument is a pointer to a \fBcmsghdr\fP structure, this macro
shall return an unsigned character pointer to the data array
associated with the \fBcmsghdr\fP structure.
.TP 7
CMSG_NXTHDR(\fImhdr,cmsg\fP)
.sp
If the first argument is a pointer to a \fBmsghdr\fP structure and
the second argument is a pointer to a \fBcmsghdr\fP structure
in the ancillary data pointed to by the \fImsg_control\fP field of
that \fBmsghdr\fP structure, this macro shall return a pointer
to the next \fBcmsghdr\fP structure, or a null pointer if this structure
is the last \fBcmsghdr\fP in the ancillary data.
.TP 7
CMSG_FIRSTHDR(\fImhdr\fP)
.sp
If the argument is a pointer to a \fBmsghdr\fP structure, this macro
shall return a pointer to the first \fBcmsghdr\fP structure
in the ancillary data associated with this \fBmsghdr\fP structure,
or a null pointer if there is no ancillary data associated with
the \fBmsghdr\fP structure.
.sp
.LP
The \fI<sys/socket.h>\fP header shall define the \fBlinger\fP structure
that includes at least the following
members:
.sp
.RS

.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
To forestall portability problems, it is recommended that applications
not use values larger than 2**31
-1 for the \fBsocklen_t\fP type.
.LP
The \fBsockaddr_storage\fP structure solves the problem of declaring
storage for automatic variables which is both large enough
and aligned enough for storing the socket address data structure of
any family. For example, code with a file descriptor and
without the context of the address family can pass a pointer to a
variable of this type, where a pointer to a socket address
structure is expected in calls such as \fIgetpeername\fP(), and determine
the
address family by accessing the received content after the call.
.LP
The example below illustrates a data structure which aligns on a 64-bit
boundary. An implementation-defined field
\fI_ss_align\fP following \fI_ss_pad1\fP is used to force a 64-bit
alignment which covers proper alignment good enough for needs
of at least \fBsockaddr_in6\fP (IPv6) and \fBsockaddr_in\fP (IPv4)
address data structures. The size of padding field
\fI_ss_pad1\fP depends on the chosen alignment boundary. The size
of padding field \fI_ss_pad2\fP depends on the value of overall
size chosen for the total size of the structure. This size and alignment
are represented in the above example by
implementation-defined (not required) constants _SS_MAXSIZE (chosen
value 128) and _SS_ALIGNMENT (with chosen value 8). Constants
_SS_PAD1SIZE (derived value 6) and _SS_PAD2SIZE (derived value 112)
are also for illustration and not required. The
implementation-defined definitions and structure field names above
start with an underscore to denote implementation private name
space. Portable code is not expected to access or reference those
fields or constants.
