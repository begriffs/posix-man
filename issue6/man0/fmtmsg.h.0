.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <fmtmsg.h> \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<fmtmsg.h>\fP header shall define the following macros, which
expand to constant integer expressions:
.TP 7
MM_HARD
Source of the condition is hardware.
.TP 7
MM_SOFT
Source of the condition is software.
.TP 7
MM_FIRM
Source of the condition is firmware.
.TP 7
MM_APPL
Condition detected by application.
.TP 7
MM_UTIL
Condition detected by utility.
.TP 7
MM_OPSYS
Condition detected by operating system.
.TP 7
MM_RECOVER
Recoverable error.
.TP 7
MM_NRECOV
Non-recoverable error.
.TP 7
MM_HALT
Error causing application to halt.
.TP 7
MM_ERROR
Application has encountered a non-fatal fault.
.TP 7
MM_WARNING
Application has detected unusual non-error condition.
.TP 7
MM_INFO
Informative message.
.TP 7
MM_NOSEV
No severity level provided for the message.
.TP 7
MM_PRINT
Display message on standard error.
.TP 7
MM_CONSOLE
Display message on system console.

The table below indicates the null values and identifiers for \fIfmtmsg\fP()
arguments.
The \fI<fmtmsg.h>\fP header shall define the macros in the \fBIdentifier\fP
column, which expand to constant expressions
that expand to expressions of the type indicated in the \fBType\fP
column:
.TS C
center; l l l l.
\fBArgument\fP	\fBType\fP	\fBNull-Value\fP	\fBIdentifier\fP
\fIlabel\fP	\fBchar *\fP	(\fBchar\fP*)0	MM_NULLLBL

\fItag\fP	\fBchar *\fP	(\fBchar\fP*)0	MM_NULLTAG
.TE
.LP
The \fI<fmtmsg.h>\fP header shall also define the following macros
for use as return values for \fIfmtmsg\fP():
.TP 7
MM_OK
The function succeeded.
.TP 7
MM_NOTOK
The function failed completely.
.TP 7
MM_NOMSG
The function was unable to generate a message on standard error, but
otherwise succeeded.
.TP 7
MM_NOCON
The function was unable to generate a console message, but otherwise
succeeded.
