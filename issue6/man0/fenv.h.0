.SH NAME
fenv.h \- floating-point environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <fenv.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<fenv.h>\fP header shall define the following data types through
\fBtypedef\fP:
.TP 7
\fBfenv_t\fP
Represents the entire floating-point environment. The floating-point
environment refers collectively to any floating-point
status flags and control modes supported by the implementation.
.TP 7
\fBfexcept_t\fP
Represents the floating-point status flags collectively, including
any status the implementation associates with the flags. A
floating-point status flag is a system variable whose value is set
(but never cleared) when a floating-point exception is raised,
which occurs as a side effect of exceptional floating-point arithmetic
to provide auxiliary information. A floating-point control
mode is a system variable whose value may be set by the user to affect
the subsequent behavior of floating-point arithmetic.
.sp
.LP
The \fI<fenv.h>\fP header shall define the following constants if
and only if the implementation supports the
floating-point exception by means of the floating-point functions
\fIfeclearexcept\fP(), \fIfegetexceptflag\fP(), \fIferaiseexcept\fP(),
\fIfesetexceptflag\fP(), and \fIfetestexcept\fP(). Each expands to
an integer constant expression with values such that
bitwise-inclusive ORs of all combinations of the constants result
in distinct values.

.LP
The \fI<fenv.h>\fP header shall define the following constant, which
is simply the bitwise-inclusive OR of all
floating-point exception constants defined above:
.sp
.RS
.nf

FE_ALL_EXCEPT
.fi
.RE
.LP
The \fI<fenv.h>\fP header shall define the following constants if
and only if the implementation supports getting and
setting the represented rounding direction by means of the \fIfegetround\fP()
and \fIfesetround\fP() functions. Each expands to an integer constant
expression whose values
are distinct non-negative vales.
.sp
.RS
.nf

FE_DOWNWARD
FE_TONEAREST
FE_TOWARDZERO
FE_UPWARD
.fi
.RE
.LP
The \fI<fenv.h>\fP header shall define the following constant, which
represents the default floating-point environment
(that is, the one installed at program startup) and has type pointer
to const-qualified \fBfenv_t\fP. It can be used as an
argument to the functions within the \fI<fenv.h>\fP header that manage
the floating-point environment.

.LP
The FENV_ACCESS pragma provides a means to inform the implementation
when an application might access the floating-point
environment to test floating-point status flags or run under non-default
floating-point control modes. The pragma shall occur
either outside external declarations or preceding all explicit declarations
and statements inside a compound statement. When
outside external declarations, the pragma takes effect from its occurrence
until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered, or
until the end of the translation unit. When inside a compound statement,
the pragma takes effect from its occurrence until another
FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered (including within a nested compound
statement), or until the end of the compound statement; at
the end of a compound statement the state for the pragma is restored
to its condition just before the compound statement. If this
pragma is used in any other context, the behavior is undefined. If
part of an application tests floating-point status flags, sets
floating-point control modes, or runs under non-default mode settings,
but was translated with the state for the FENV_ACCESS pragma
off, the behavior is undefined. The default state (on or off) for
the pragma is implementation-defined. (When execution passes from
a part of the application translated with FENV_ACCESS off to a part
translated with FENV_ACCESS on, the state of the floating-point
status flags is unspecified and the floating-point control modes have
their default settings.)
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
This header is designed to support the floating-point exception status
flags and directed-rounding control modes required by the
IEC\ 60559:1989 standard, and other similar floating-point state information.
Also it is designed to facilitate code
portability among all systems.
.LP
Certain application programming conventions support the intended model
of use for the floating-point environment:
.IP " *" 3
A function call does not alter its caller's floating-point control
modes, clear its caller's floating-point status flags, nor
depend on the state of its caller's floating-point status flags unless
the function is so documented.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
A function call is assumed to require default floating-point control
modes, unless its documentation promises otherwise.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
A function call is assumed to have the potential for raising floating-point
exceptions, unless its documentation promises
otherwise.
.LP
.LP
With these conventions, an application can safely assume default floating-point
control modes (or be unaware of them). The
responsibilities associated with accessing the floating-point environment
fall on the application that does so explicitly.
.LP
Even though the rounding direction macros may expand to constants
corresponding to the values of FLT_ROUNDS, they are not
required to do so.
.LP
For example:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB#include <fenv.h>
void f(double x)
{
    #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
    void g(double);
    void h(double);
    /* ... */
    g(x + 1);
    h(x + 1);
    /* ... */
}
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
If the function \fIg\fP() might depend on status flags set as a side
effect of the first \fIx\fP+1, or if the second
\fIx\fP+1 might depend on control modes set as a side effect of the
call to function \fIg\fP(), then the application shall
contain an appropriately placed invocation as follows:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH RATIONALE
.SS The fexcept_t Type
.LP
\fBfexcept_t\fP does not have to be an integer type. Its values must
be obtained by a call to \fIfegetexceptflag\fP(), and cannot be created
by logical operations from the exception
macros. An implementation might simply implement \fBfexcept_t\fP as
an \fBint\fP and use the representations reflected by the
exception macros, but is not required to; other representations might
contain extra information about the exceptions.
\fBfexcept_t\fP might be a \fBstruct\fP with a member for each exception
(that might hold the address of the first or last
floating-point instruction that caused that exception). The ISO/IEC\ 9899:1999
standard makes no claims about the internals of
an \fBfexcept_t\fP, and so the user cannot inspect it.
.SS Exception and Rounding Macros
.LP
Macros corresponding to unsupported modes and rounding directions
are not defined by the implementation and must not be defined
by the application. An application might use \fB#ifdef\fP to test
for this.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
