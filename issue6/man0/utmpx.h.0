.SH NAME
utmpx.h \- user accounting database definitions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <utmpx.h> \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<utmpx.h>\fP header shall define the \fButmpx\fP structure
that shall include at least the following members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBchar            ut_user[] \fP User login name. \fB
char            ut_id[]   \fP Unspecified initialization process identifier. \fB
char            ut_line[] \fP Device name. \fB
pid_t           ut_pid    \fP Process ID. \fB
short           ut_type   \fP Type of entry. \fB
struct timeval  ut_tv     \fP Time entry was made. \fB
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The \fBpid_t\fP type shall be defined through \fBtypedef\fP as described
in \fI<sys/types.h>\fP .
.LP
The \fBtimeval\fP structure shall be defined as described in \fI<sys/time.h>\fP
\&.
.LP
Inclusion of the \fI<utmpx.h>\fP header may also make visible all
symbols from \fI<sys/time.h>\fP.
.LP
The following symbolic constants shall be defined as possible values
for the \fIut_type\fP member of the \fButmpx\fP
structure:
.TP 7
EMPTY
No valid user accounting information.
.TP 7
BOOT_TIME
Identifies time of system boot.
.TP 7
OLD_TIME
Identifies time when system clock changed.
.TP 7
NEW_TIME
Identifies time after system clock changed.
.TP 7
USER_PROCESS
Identifies a process.
.TP 7
INIT_PROCESS
Identifies a process spawned by the init process.
.TP 7
LOGIN_PROCESS
Identifies the session leader of a logged-in user.
.TP 7
DEAD_PROCESS
Identifies a session leader who has exited.
.sp
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
