.SH NAME
stddef.h \- standard type definitions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stddef.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<stddef.h>\fP header shall define the following macros:
.TP 7
NULL
Null pointer constant.
.TP 7
offsetof(\fItype\fP, \fImember-designator\fP)
.sp
Integer constant expression of type \fBsize_t\fP, the value of which
is the offset in bytes to the structure member
(\fImember-designator\fP), from the beginning of its structure (\fItype\fP).
.sp
.LP
The \fI<stddef.h>\fP header shall define the following types:
.TP 7
\fBptrdiff_t\fP
Signed integer type of the result of subtracting two pointers.
.TP 7
\fBwchar_t\fP
Integer type whose range of values can represent distinct wide-character
codes for all members of the largest character set
specified among the locales supported by the compilation environment:
the null character has the code value 0 and each member of
the portable character set has a code value equal to its value when
used as the lone character in an integer character
constant.
.TP 7
\fBsize_t\fP
Unsigned integer type of the result of the \fIsizeof\fP operator.
.sp
.LP
The implementation shall support one or more programming environments
in which the widths of \fBptrdiff_t\fP, \fBsize_t\fP,
and \fBwchar_t\fP are no greater than the width of type \fBlong\fP.
The names of these programming environments can be obtained
using the \fIconfstr\fP() function or the \fIgetconf\fP utility.
