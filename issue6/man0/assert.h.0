.SH NAME
assert.h \- verify program assertion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <assert.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<assert.h>\fP header shall define the \fIassert\fP() macro.
It refers to
the macro NDEBUG which is not defined in the header. If NDEBUG is
defined as a macro name before the inclusion of this header, the
\fIassert\fP() macro shall be defined simply as:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB#define assert(ignore)((void) 0)
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Otherwise, the macro behaves as described in \fIassert\fP().
.LP
The \fIassert\fP() macro shall be redefined according to the current
state of NDEBUG
each time \fI<assert.h>\fP is included.
.LP
The \fIassert\fP() macro shall be implemented as a macro, not as a
function. If the
macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function,
the behavior is undefined.
