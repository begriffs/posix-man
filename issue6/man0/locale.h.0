.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Some of the functionality described on this reference page extends
the ISO\ C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\ C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\ C standard. 
.LP
The \fI<locale.h>\fP header shall provide a definition for \fBlconv\fP
structure, which shall include at least the
following members. (See the definitions of \fILC_MONETARY\fP in \fILC_MONETARY\fP
and
\fILC_NUMERIC\fP .)

which shall expand to distinct integer constant expressions, for use
as the first argument to the \fIsetlocale\fP() function.
.LP
Additional macro definitions, beginning with the characters \fILC_\fP
and an uppercase letter, may also be given here.

The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
