.SH NAME
sys/stat.h \- data returned by the stat() function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <sys/stat.h>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<sys/stat.h>\fP header shall define the structure of the data
returned by the functions \fIfstat\fP(), \fIlstat\fP(), and \fIstat\fP().
.LP
The \fBstat\fP structure shall contain at least the following members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBdev_t     st_dev    \fP Device ID of device containing file. \fB
ino_t     st_ino    \fP File serial number. \fB
mode_t    st_mode   \fP Mode of file (see below). \fB
nlink_t   st_nlink  \fP Number of hard links to the file. \fB
uid_t     st_uid    \fP User ID of file. \fB
gid_t     st_gid    \fP Group ID of file. \fB

dev_t     st_rdev   \fP Device ID (if file is character or block special). \fB

off_t     st_size   \fP For regular files, the file size in bytes. \fB
                    \fP For symbolic links, the length in bytes of the \fB
                    \fP pathname contained in the symbolic link. \fB

                    \fP For a shared memory object, the length in bytes. \fB


                    \fP For a typed memory object, the length in bytes. \fB

                    \fP For other file types, the use of this field is \fB
                    \fP unspecified. \fB
time_t    st_atime  \fP Time of last access. \fB
time_t    st_mtime  \fP Time of last data modification. \fB
time_t    st_ctime  \fP Time of last status change. \fB

blksize_t st_blksize\fP A file system-specific preferred I/O block size for \fB
                    \fP this object. In some file system types, this may \fB
                    \fP vary from file to file. \fB
blkcnt_t  st_blocks \fP Number of blocks allocated for this object. \fB

.LP
The \fIst_ino\fP and \fIst_dev\fP fields taken together uniquely identify
the file within the system. The \fBblkcnt_t\fP,
\fBblksize_t\fP, \fBdev_t\fP, \fBino_t\fP, \fBmode_t\fP, \fBnlink_t\fP,
\fBuid_t\fP, \fBgid_t\fP, \fBoff_t\fP, and
\fBtime_t\fP types shall be defined as described in \fI<sys/types.h>\fP
\&. Times
shall be given in seconds since the Epoch.
.LP
Unless otherwise specified, the structure members \fIst_mode\fP, \fIst_ino\fP,
\fIst_dev\fP, \fIst_uid\fP, \fIst_gid\fP,
\fIst_atime\fP, \fIst_ctime\fP, and \fIst_mtime\fP shall have meaningful
values for all file types defined in
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001.
.LP
For symbolic links, the \fIst_mode\fP member shall contain meaningful
information, which can be used with the file type macros
described below, that take a \fImode\fP argument. The \fIst_size\fP
member shall contain the length, in bytes, of the pathname
contained in the symbolic link. File mode bits and the contents of
the remaining members of the \fBstat\fP structure are
unspecified. The value returned in the \fIst_size\fP field shall be
the length of the contents of the symbolic link, and shall not
count a trailing null if one is present.
.LP
The following symbolic names for the values of type \fBmode_t\fP shall
also be defined.

\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Use of the macros is recommended for determining the type of a file.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
A conforming C-language application must include \fI<sys/stat.h>\fP
for functions that have arguments or return values of
type \fBmode_t\fP, so that symbolic values for that type can be used.
An alternative would be to require that these constants are
also defined by including \fI<sys/types.h>\fP.
.LP
The S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits may be cleared on any write, not just
on \fIopen\fP(), as
some historical implementations do.
.LP
System calls that update the time entry fields in the \fBstat\fP structure
must be documented by the implementors.
POSIX-conforming systems should not update the time entry fields for
functions listed in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 unless the standard requires that they do,
except in the case of documented extensions to the
standard.
.LP
Note that \fIst_dev\fP must be unique within a Local Area Network
(LAN) in a ``system'' made up of multiple computers' file
systems connected by a LAN.
.LP
Networked implementations of a POSIX-conforming system must guarantee
that all files visible within the file tree (including
parts of the tree that may be remotely mounted from other machines
on the network) on each individual processor are uniquely
identified by the combination of the \fIst_ino\fP and \fIst_dev\fP
fields.
.LP
The unit for the \fIst_blocks\fP member of the \fBstat\fP structure
is not defined within IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001. In
some implementations it is 512 bytes. It may differ on a file system
basis. There is no correlation between values of the
\fIst_blocks\fP and \fIst_blksize\fP, and the \fIf_bsize\fP (from
\fI<sys/statvfs.h>\fP) structure members.
.LP
Traditionally, some implementations defined the multiplier for \fIst_blocks\fP
in 
\fI<sys/param.h>\fP as the symbol DEV_BSIZE.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
No new S_IFMT symbolic names for the file type values of \fBmode_t\fP
will be defined by IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001; if new
file types are required, they will only be testable through \fIS_ISxx\fP()
or \fIS_TYPEISxxx\fP() macros instead.
