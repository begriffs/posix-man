.SH NAME
aio.h \- asynchronous input and output (\fBREALTIME\fP)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <aio.h> \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fI<aio.h>\fP header shall define the \fBaiocb\fP structure which
shall include at least the following members:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBint             aio_fildes    \fP File descriptor. \fB
off_t           aio_offset    \fP File offset. \fB
volatile void  *aio_buf       \fP Location of buffer. \fB
size_t          aio_nbytes    \fP Length of transfer. \fB
int             aio_reqprio   \fP Request priority offset. \fB
struct sigevent aio_sigevent  \fP Signal number and value. \fB
int             aio_lio_opcode\fP Operation to be performed. \fB
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
This header shall also include the following constants:
.TP 7
AIO_ALLDONE
A return value indicating that none of the requested operations could
be canceled since they are already complete.
.TP 7
AIO_CANCELED
A return value indicating that all requested operations have been
canceled.
.TP 7
AIO_NOTCANCELED
.sp
A return value indicating that some of the requested operations could
not be canceled since they are in progress.
.TP 7
LIO_NOP
A \fIlio_listio\fP() element operation option indicating that no transfer
is
requested.
.TP 7
LIO_NOWAIT
A \fIlio_listio\fP() synchronization operation indicating that the
calling thread
is to continue execution while the \fIlio_listio\fP() operation is
being performed, and
no notification is given when the operation is complete.
.TP 7
LIO_READ
A \fIlio_listio\fP() element operation option requesting a read.
.TP 7
LIO_WAIT
A \fIlio_listio\fP() synchronization operation indicating that the
calling thread
is to suspend until the \fIlio_listio\fP() operation is complete.
.TP 7
LIO_WRITE
A \fIlio_listio\fP() element operation option requesting a write.
.sp
.LP
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBint      aio_cancel(int, struct aiocb *);
int      aio_error(const struct aiocb *);
