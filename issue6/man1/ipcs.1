.SH NAME
ipcs \- report XSI interprocess communication facilities status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBipcs\fP \fB[\fP\fB-qms\fP\fB][\fP\fB-a | -bcopt\fP\fB]\fP\fB\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIipcs\fP utility shall write information about active interprocess
communication facilities.
.LP
Without options, information shall be written in short format for
message queues, shared memory segments, and semaphore sets
that are currently active in the system. Otherwise, the information
that is displayed is controlled by the options specified.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fIipcs\fP facility supports the Base Definitions volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001,
Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
.LP
The \fIipcs\fP utility accepts the following options:
.TP 7
\fB-q\fP
Write information about active message queues.
.TP 7
\fB-m\fP
Write information about active shared memory segments.
.TP 7
\fB-s\fP
Write information about active semaphore sets.
.sp
.LP
If \fB-q\fP, \fB-m\fP, or \fB-s\fP are specified, only information
about those facilities shall be written. If none of these
three are specified, information about all three shall be written
subject to the following options:
.TP 7
\fB-a\fP
Use all print options. (This is a shorthand notation for \fB-b\fP,
\fB-c\fP, \fB-o\fP, \fB-p\fP, and \fB-t\fP.)
.TP 7
\fB-b\fP
Write information on maximum allowable size. (Maximum number of bytes
in messages on queue for message queues, size of segments
for shared memory, and number of semaphores in each set for semaphores.)
.TP 7
\fB-c\fP
Write creator's user name and group name; see below.
.TP 7
\fB-o\fP
Write information on outstanding usage. (Number of messages on queue
and total number of bytes in messages on queue for message
queues, and number of processes attached to shared memory segments.)
.TP 7
\fB-p\fP
Write process number information. (Process ID of the last process
to send a message and process ID of the last process to
receive a message on message queues, process ID of the creating process,
and process ID of the last process to attach or detach on
shared memory segments.)
.TP 7
\fB-t\fP
Write time information. (Time of the last control operation that changed
the access permissions for all facilities, time of the
last \fImsgsnd\fP() and \fImsgrcv\fP() operations
on message queues, time of the last \fIshmat\fP() and \fIshmdt\fP()
operations on shared memory, and time of the last \fIsemop\fP() operation
on semaphores.)
.sp
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
None.
.SH STDIN
.LP
Not used.
.SH INPUT FILES
.IP " *" 3
The group database
.LP
.IP " *" 3

.LP
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIipcs\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP 7
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
.TP 7
\fINLSPATH\fP
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of \fILC_MESSAGES
\&.\fP
.TP 7
\fITZ\fP
Determine the timezone for the date and time strings written by \fIipcs\fP.
If \fITZ\fP is unset or null, an unspecified
default timezone shall be used.
.sp
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP
Default.
.SH STDOUT
.LP
An introductory line shall be written with the format:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"IPC status from %s as of %s\\n", <\fP\fIsource\fP\fB>, <\fP\fIdate\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
where <\fIsource\fP> indicates the source used to gather the statistics
and <\fIdate\fP> is the information that
would be produced by the \fIdate\fP command when invoked in the POSIX
locale.
.LP
The \fIipcs\fP utility then shall create up to three reports depending
upon the \fB-q\fP, \fB-m\fP, and \fB-s\fP options.
The first report shall indicate the status of message queues, the
second report shall indicate the status of shared memory
segments, and the third report shall indicate the status of semaphore
sets.
.LP
If the corresponding facility is not installed or has not been used
since the last reboot, then the report shall be written out
in the format:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"%s facility not in system.\\n", <\fP\fIfacility\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
where <\fIfacility\fP> is \fIMessage Queue\fP, \fIShared Memory\fP,
or \fISemaphore\fP, as appropriate. If the
facility has been installed and has been used since the last reboot,
column headings separated by one or more spaces and followed
by a <newline> shall be written as indicated below followed by the
facility name written out using the format:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"%s:\\n", <\fP\fIfacility\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
where <\fIfacility\fP> is \fIMessage Queues\fP, \fIShared Memory\fP,
or \fISemaphores\fP, as appropriate. On the
second and third reports the column headings need not be written if
the last column headings written already provide column
headings for all information in that report.
.LP
The column headings provided in the first column below and the meaning
of the information in those columns shall be given in
order below; the letters in parentheses indicate the options that
shall cause the corresponding column to appear; "all" means
that the column shall always appear. Each column is separated by one
or more <space>s. Note that these options only determine
what information is provided for each report; they do not determine
which reports are written.
