.SH NAME
readonly \- set the readonly attribute for variables

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The variables whose \fIname\fPs are specified shall be given the \fIreadonly\fP
attribute. The values of variables with the
\fIreadonly\fP attribute cannot be changed by subsequent assignment,
nor can those variables be unset by the \fIunset\fP utility. If the
name of a variable is followed by = \fIword\fP, then the value of
that
variable shall be set to \fIword\fP.
.LP
The \fIreadonly\fP special built-in shall support the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
.LP
When \fB-p\fP is specified, \fIreadonly\fP writes to the standard
output the names and values of all read-only variables, in
the following format:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"readonly %s=%s\\n", <\fP\fIname\fP\fB>, <\fP\fIvalue\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
if \fIname\fP is set, and
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"readonly %s\\n", <\fP\fIname\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
if \fIname\fP is unset.
.LP
The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of quoting,
so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as
commands that achieve the same value and \fIreadonly\fP attribute-setting
results in a shell execution environment in which:
.IP " 1." 4
Variables with values at the time they were output do not have the
\fIreadonly\fP attribute set.
.LP
.IP " 2." 4
Variables that were unset at the time they were output do not have
a value at the time at which the saved output is reinput to
the shell.
.LP
.LP
When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified.

.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Some historical shells preserve the \fIreadonly\fP attribute across
separate invocations. This volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 allows this behavior, but does not require
it.
.LP
The \fB-p\fP option allows portable access to the values that can
be saved and then later restored using, for example, a \fIdot\fP script.
Also see the RATIONALE for \fIexport\fP
for a description of the no-argument and \fB-p\fP output cases and
a related example.
.LP
Read-only functions were considered, but they were omitted as not
being historical practice or particularly useful. Furthermore,
functions must not be read-only across invocations to preclude ``spoofing''
(spoofing is the term for the practice of creating a
program that acts like a well-known utility with the intent of subverting
the real intent of the user) of administrative or
security-relevant (or security-conscious) shell scripts.
