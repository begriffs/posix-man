.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBtrap\fP \fB[\fP\fIaction condition\fP \fB...\fP\fB]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
If \fIaction\fP is \fB'-'\fP, the shell shall reset each \fIcondition\fP
to the default value. If \fIaction\fP is null (
\fB""\fP ), the shell shall ignore each specified \fIcondition\fP
if it arises. Otherwise, the argument \fIaction\fP shall be
read and executed by the shell when one of the corresponding conditions
arises. The action of \fItrap\fP shall override a previous
action (either default action or one explicitly set). The value of
\fB"$?"\fP after the \fItrap\fP action completes shall be
the value it had before \fItrap\fP was invoked.
.LP
The condition can be EXIT, 0 (equivalent to EXIT), or a signal specified
using a symbolic name, without the SIG prefix, as
listed in the tables of signal names in the \fI<signal.h>\fP header
defined in the
Base Definitions volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Chapter 13, Headers;
for example, HUP, INT, QUIT, TERM. Implementations may permit names
with the SIG prefix or ignore case in signal names as an
extension. Setting a trap for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP produces undefined
results.
.LP
The environment in which the shell executes a \fItrap\fP on EXIT shall
be identical to the environment immediately after the
last command executed before the \fItrap\fP on EXIT was taken.
.LP
Each time \fItrap\fP is invoked, the \fIaction\fP argument shall be
processed in a manner equivalent to:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBeval\fP \fIaction\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Signals that were ignored on entry to a non-interactive shell cannot
be trapped or reset, although no error need be reported
when attempting to do so. An interactive shell may reset or catch
signals ignored on entry. Traps shall remain in place for a given
shell until explicitly changed with another \fItrap\fP command.
.LP
When a subshell is entered, traps that are not being ignored are set
to the default actions. This does not imply that the
\fItrap\fP command cannot be used within the subshell to set new traps.
.LP
The \fItrap\fP command with no arguments shall write to standard output
a list of commands associated with each condition. The
format shall be:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"trap -- %s %s ...\\n", <\fP\fIaction\fP\fB>, <\fP\fIcondition\fP\fB> ...
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of quoting,
so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as
commands that achieve the same trapping results. For example:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsave_traps=$(trap)
\&...
eval "$save_traps"
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
XSI-conformant systems also allow numeric signal numbers for the conditions
corresponding to the following signal names: 
.TS C
center; l l.
\fBSignal Number\fP	\fBSignal Name\fP
1	SIGHUP
2	SIGINT
3	SIGQUIT
6	SIGABRT
9	SIGKILL
14	SIGALRM
15	SIGTERM
.TE
.LP
The \fItrap\fP special built-in shall conform to the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.LP
None.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
If the trap name  or number  is invalid, a non-zero
exit status shall be returned; otherwise, zero shall be returned.
For both interactive and non-interactive shells, invalid signal
names  or numbers  shall not be considered a syntax error and do
not cause the shell to abort.
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS

None.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
Write out a list of all traps and actions:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBtrap
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Set a trap so the \fIlogout\fP utility in the directory referred to
by the \fIHOME\fP
environment variable executes when the shell terminates:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBtrap '$HOME/logout' EXIT
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
or:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBtrap '$HOME/logout' 0
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Unset traps on INT, QUIT, TERM, and EXIT:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBtrap - INT QUIT TERM EXIT
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Implementations may permit lowercase signal names as an extension.
Implementations may also accept the names with the SIG
prefix; no known historical shell does so. The \fItrap\fP and \fIkill\fP
utilities in this
volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 are now consistent in their omission
of the SIG prefix for signal names. Some \fIkill\fP implementations
do not allow the prefix, and \fIkill\fP \fB-l\fP lists the signals
without prefixes.
.LP
Trapping SIGKILL or SIGSTOP is syntactically accepted by some historical
implementations, but it has no effect. Portable POSIX
applications cannot attempt to trap these signals.
.LP
The output format is not historical practice. Since the output of
historical \fItrap\fP commands is not portable (because
numeric signal values are not portable) and had to change to become
so, an opportunity was taken to format the output in a way that
a shell script could use to save and then later reuse a trap if it
wanted.
.LP
The KornShell uses an \fBERR\fP trap that is triggered whenever \fIset\fP
\fB-e\fP would
cause an exit. This is allowable as an extension, but was not mandated,
as other shells have not used it.
.LP
The text about the environment for the EXIT trap invalidates the behavior
of some historical versions of interactive shells
which, for example, close the standard input before executing a trap
on 0. For example, in some historical interactive shell
sessions the following trap on 0 would always print \fB"--"\fP :
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBtrap 'read foo; echo "-$foo-"' 0
\fP
.fi
