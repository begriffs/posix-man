.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
In the first synopsis form, the \fIgetconf\fP utility shall write
to the standard output the value of the variable specified by
the \fIsystem_var\fP operand.
.LP
In the second synopsis form, the \fIgetconf\fP utility shall write
to the standard output the value of the variable specified
by the \fIpath_var\fP operand for the path specified by the \fIpathname\fP
operand.
.LP
The value of each configuration variable shall be determined as if
it were obtained by calling the function from which it is
defined to be available by this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 or
by the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 (see the OPERANDS section). The value shall
reflect conditions in the current operating
environment.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIgetconf\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)

\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
.TP 7
\fINLSPATH\fP
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of \fILC_MESSAGES
\&.\fP 
.sp
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP
Default.
.SH STDOUT
.LP
If the specified variable is defined on the system and its value is
described to be available from the \fIconfstr\fP() function defined
in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, its value shall be written in the following
format:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"%s\\n", <\fP\fIvalue\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Otherwise, if the specified variable is defined on the system, its
value shall be written in the following format:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"%d\\n", <\fP\fIvalue\fP\fB>
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
If the specified variable is valid, but is undefined on the system,
\fIgetconf\fP shall write using the following format:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB"undefined\\n"
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
If the variable name is invalid or an error occurs, nothing shall
be written to standard output.
.SH STDERR
.LP
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH OUTPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.LP
None.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values shall be returned:
.TP 7
\ 0
The specified variable is valid and information about its current
state was written successfully.
.TP 7
>0
An error occurred.
.sp
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
Default.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The following example illustrates the value of {NGROUPS_MAX}:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBgetconf NGROUPS_MAX
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The following example illustrates the value of {NAME_MAX} for a specific
directory:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBgetconf NAME_MAX /usr
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
The following example shows how to deal more carefully with results
that might be unspecified:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBif value=$(getconf PATH_MAX /usr); then
    if [ "$value" = "undefined" ]; then
        echo PATH_MAX in /usr is infinite.
    else
        echo PATH_MAX in /usr is $value.
    fi
else
    echo Error in getconf.
fi
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Note that:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsysconf(_SC_POSIX_C_BIND);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
and:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBsystem("getconf POSIX2_C_BIND");
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
in a C program could give different answers. The \fIsysconf\fP() call
supplies a value
that corresponds to the conditions when the program was either compiled
or executed, depending on the implementation; the \fIsystem\fP() call
to \fIgetconf\fP always supplies a value corresponding to conditions
when the
program is executed.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The original need for this utility, and for the \fIconfstr\fP() function,
was to
provide a way of finding the configuration-defined default value for
the \fIPATH\fP environment variable. Since \fIPATH\fP can be
modified by the user to include directories that could contain utilities
replacing the standard utilities, shell scripts need a way
to determine the system-supplied \fIPATH\fP environment variable value
that contains the correct search path for the standard
utilities. It was later suggested that access to the other variables
described in this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001
could also be useful to applications.
.LP
This functionality of \fIgetconf\fP would not be adequately subsumed
by another command such as:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBgrep\fP \fIvar\fP \fB/etc/conf
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
because such a strategy would provide correct values for neither those
variables that can vary at runtime, nor those that can
vary depending on the path.
.LP
Early proposal versions of \fIgetconf\fP specified exit status 1 when
the specified variable was valid, but not defined on the
system. The output string \fB"undefined"\fP is now used to specify
this case with exit code 0 because so many things depend on
an exit code of zero when an invoked utility is successful.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
