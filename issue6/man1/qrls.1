qrls \- release batch jobs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBqrls\fP \fB[\fP\fB-h\fP \fIhold_list\fP\fB]\fP \fIjob_identifier\fP
\fB\&... \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
A batch job might have one or more holds, which prevent the batch
job from executing. A batch job from which all the holds have
been removed becomes eligible for execution and is said to have been
released. A batch job hold is removed by sending a request to
the batch server that manages the batch job. The \fIqrls\fP utility
is a user-accessible client of batch services that requests
holds be removed from one or more batch jobs.
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility shall remove one or more holds from those batch
jobs for which a batch \fIjob_identifier\fP is
presented to the utility.
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility shall remove holds from batch jobs in the order
in which their batch \fIjob_identifier\fPs are
presented to the utility.
.LP
If the \fIqrls\fP utility fails to process a batch \fIjob_identifier\fP
successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the
remaining batch \fIjob_identifier\fPs, if any.
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility shall remove holds on each batch job by sending
a \fIRelease Job Request\fP to the batch server that
manages the batch job.
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility shall not exit until the holds have been removed
from the batch job corresponding to each successfully
processed batch \fIjob_identifier\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
.LP
The following option shall be supported by the implementation:
.TP 7
\fB-h\ \fP \fIhold_list\fP
Define the types of holds to be removed from the batch job. 
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP \fB-h\fP option shall accept a value for the \fIhold_list\fP
option-argument that is a string of alphanumeric
characters in the portable character set (see the Base Definitions
volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 6.1, Portable Character
Set).
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility shall accept a value for the \fIhold_list\fP
option-argument that is a string of one or more of the
characters \fB'u'\fP, \fB's'\fP, or \fB'o'\fP, or the single character
\fB'n'\fP .
.LP
For each unique character in the \fIhold_list\fP option-argument,
the \fIqrls\fP utility shall add a value to the
\fIHold_Types\fP attribute of the batch job as follows, each representing
a different hold type:
.TP 7
\fBu\fP
.RS
USER
.RE
.TP 7
\fBs\fP
.RS
SYSTEM
.RE
.TP 7
\fBo\fP
.RS
OPERATOR
.RE
.sp
.LP
If any of these characters are duplicated in the \fIhold_list\fP option-argument,
the duplicates shall be ignored.
.LP
An existing \fIHold_Types\fP attribute can be cleared by the following
hold type:
.TP 7
\fBn\fP
.RS
NO_HOLD
.RE
.sp
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility shall consider it an error if any hold type
other than \fB'n'\fP is combined with hold type
\fB'n'\fP .
.LP
Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of the characters
\fB'u'\fP, \fB's'\fP, \fB'o'\fP, or
\fB'n'\fP within the \fIhold_list\fP option-argument. The \fIqrls\fP
utility shall permit the repetition of characters, but
shall not assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.
.LP
An implementation may define other hold types. The conformance document
for an implementation shall describe any additional hold
types, how they are specified, their internal behavior, and how they
affect the behavior of the utility.
.LP
If the \fB-h\fP option is not presented to the \fIqrls\fP utility,
the implementation shall remove the USER hold in the
\fIHold_Types\fP attribute.
.sp
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility shall accept one or more operands that conform
to the syntax for a batch \fIjob_identifier\fP (see \fIBatch Job Identifier\fP
).
.SH STDIN
.LP
Not used.
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIqrls\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP 7
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
.TP 7
\fILOGNAME\fP
Determine the login name of the user.
.sp
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP
Default.
.SH STDOUT
.LP
None.
.SH STDERR
.LP
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH OUTPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.LP
None.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values shall be returned:
.TP 7
\ 0
Successful completion.
.TP 7
>0
An error occurred.
.sp
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
In addition to the default behavior, the \fIqrls\fP utility shall
not be required to write a diagnostic message to standard
error when the error reply received from a batch server indicates
that the batch \fIjob_identifier\fP does not exist on the
server. Whether or not the \fIqrls\fP utility waits to output the
diagnostic message while attempting to locate the job on other
servers is implementation-defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility allows users, operators, and administrators
to remove holds from jobs.
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility does not support any job selection options
or wildcard arguments. Users may acquire a list of jobs
selected by attributes using the \fIqselect\fP utility. For example,
a user could select
all of their held jobs.
.LP
The \fB-h\fP option allows the user to specify the type of hold that
is to be removed. This option allows for USER, SYSTEM,
OPERATOR, and implementation-defined hold types. The batch server
that manages the batch job will verify whether the user is
authorized to remove the specified hold for the batch job. If more
than one type of hold has been placed on the batch job, a user
may wish to remove only some of them.
.LP
Mail is not required on release because the administrator has the
tools and libraries to build this option if required.
.LP
The \fIqrls\fP utility is a new utility \fIvis-a-vis\fP existing practice;
it has been defined in this volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 as the natural complement to the \fIqhold\fP
utility.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
