.SH NAME
return \- return from a function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBreturn\fP \fB[\fP\fIn\fP\fB]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIreturn\fP utility shall cause the shell to stop executing the
current function or \fIdot\fP script. If the shell is not currently
executing a function or \fIdot\fP script, the results are unspecified.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
None.
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
See the DESCRIPTION.
.SH STDIN
.LP
Not used.
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
None.
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP
Default.
.SH STDOUT
.LP
Not used.
.SH STDERR
.LP
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH OUTPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.LP
None.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The value of the special parameter \fB'?'\fP shall be set to \fIn\fP,
an unsigned decimal integer, or to the exit status of
the last command executed if \fIn\fP is not specified. If the value
of \fIn\fP is greater than 255, the results are undefined.
When \fIreturn\fP is executed in a \fItrap\fP action, the last command
is considered to be
the command that executed immediately preceding the \fItrap\fP action.
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
Default.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The behavior of \fIreturn\fP when not in a function or \fIdot\fP script
differs between
the System V shell and the KornShell. In the System V shell this is
an error, whereas in the KornShell, the effect is the same as
\fIexit\fP.
.LP
The results of returning a number greater than 255 are undefined because
of differing practices in the various historical
implementations. Some shells AND out all but the low-order 8 bits;
others allow larger values, but not of unlimited size.
.LP
See the discussion of appropriate exit status values under \fIexit\fP
\&.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
