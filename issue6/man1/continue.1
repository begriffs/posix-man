.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBcontinue\fP \fB[\fP\fIn\fP\fB]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIcontinue\fP utility shall return to the top of the smallest
enclosing \fBfor\fP, \fBwhile\fP, or \fBuntil\fP loop, or
to the top of the \fIn\fPth enclosing loop, if \fIn\fP is specified.
This involves repeating the condition list of a \fBwhile\fP
or \fBuntil\fP loop or performing the next assignment of a \fBfor\fP
loop, and re-executing the loop if appropriate.
.LP
The value of \fIn\fP is a decimal integer greater than or equal to
1. The default shall be equivalent to \fIn\fP=1. If
\fIn\fP is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the outermost
enclosing loop shall be used.
