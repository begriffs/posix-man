.SH NAME
gencat \- generate a formatted message catalog
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBgencat\fP \fIcatfile msgfile\fP\fB... \fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIgencat\fP utility shall merge the message text source file
\fImsgfile\fP into a formatted message catalog
\fIcatfile\fP. The file \fIcatfile\fP shall be created if it does
not already exist. If \fIcatfile\fP does exist, its messages
shall be included in the new \fIcatfile\fP. If set and message numbers
collide, the new message text defined in \fImsgfile\fP
shall replace the old message text currently contained in \fIcatfile\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
None.
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operands shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fIcatfile\fP
A pathname of the formatted message catalog. If \fB'-'\fP is specified,
standard output shall be used. The format of the
message catalog produced is unspecified.
.TP 7
\fImsgfile\fP
A pathname of a message text source file. If \fB'-'\fP is specified
for an instance of \fImsgfile\fP, standard input shall
be used. The format of message text source files is defined in the
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
.sp
.SH STDIN
.LP
The standard input shall not be used unless a \fImsgfile\fP operand
is specified as \fB'-'\fP .
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
The input files shall be text files.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIgencat\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP 7
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
.TP 7
\fINLSPATH\fP
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of \fILC_MESSAGES
\&.\fP
.sp
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP
Default.
.SH STDOUT
.LP
The standard output shall not be used unless the \fIcatfile\fP operand
is specified as \fB'-'\fP .
.SH STDERR
.LP
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH OUTPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.LP
The content of a message text file shall be in the format defined
as follows. Note that the fields of a message text source line
are separated by a single <blank>. Any other <blank>s are considered
to be part of the subsequent field.
.TP 7
\fB$set\ \fP \fIn\ comment\fP
.sp
This line specifies the set identifier of the following messages until
the next \fB$set\fP or end-of-file appears. The \fIn\fP
denotes the set identifier, which is defined as a number in the range
[1, {NL_SETMAX}] (see the \fI<limits.h>\fP header defined in the Base
Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001). The application shall ensure that set identifiers
are presented in ascending order within a single
source file, but need not be contiguous. Any string following the
set identifier shall be treated as a comment. If no \fB$set\fP
directive is specified in a message text source file, all messages
shall be located in an implementation-defined default message
set NL_SETD (see the \fI<nl_types.h>\fP header defined in the Base
Definitions
volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001).
.TP 7
\fB$delset\ \fP \fIn\ comment\fP
.sp
This line deletes message set \fIn\fP from an existing message catalog.
The \fIn\fP denotes the set number [1, {NL_SETMAX}]. Any
string following the set number shall be treated as a comment.
.TP 7
\fB$\ \fP \fIcomment\fP
A line beginning with \fB'$'\fP followed by a <blank> shall be treated
as a comment.
.TP 7
\fIm\ message-text\fP
.sp
The \fIm\fP denotes the message identifier, which is defined as a
number in the range [1, {NL_MSGMAX}] (see the \fI<limits.h>\fP header).
The \fImessage-text\fP shall be stored in the message catalog
with the set identifier specified by the last \fB$set\fP directive,
and with message identifier \fIm\fP. If the
\fImessage-text\fP is empty, and a <blank> field separator is present,
an empty string shall be stored in the message
catalog. If a message source line has a message number, but neither
a field separator nor \fImessage-text\fP, the existing message
with that number (if any) shall be deleted from the catalog. The application
shall ensure that message identifiers are in ascending
order within a single set, but need not be contiguous. The application
shall ensure that the length of \fImessage-text\fP is in
the range [0, {NL_TEXTMAX}] (see the \fI<limits.h>\fP header).
.TP 7
\fB$quote\ \fP \fIn\fP
This line specifies an optional quote character \fIc\fP, which can
be used to surround \fImessage-text\fP so that trailing
spaces or null (empty) messages are visible in a message source line.
By default, or if an empty \fB$quote\fP directive is
supplied, no quoting of \fImessage-text\fP shall be recognized.
.sp
.LP
Empty lines in a message text source file shall be ignored. The effects
of lines starting with any character other than those
defined above are implementation-defined.
.LP
Text strings can contain the special characters and escape sequences
defined in the following table:
.TS C
center; l l l.
\fBDescription\fP	\fBSymbol\fP	\fBSequence\fP
<newline>	NL(LF)	\\n
Horizontal-tab	HT	\\t
<vertical-tab>	VT	\\v
<backspace>	BS	\\b
<carriage-return>	CR	\\r
<form-feed>	FF	\\f
Backslash	\fB\\\fP	\\\\ 
Bit pattern	\fBddd\fP	\\ddd
.TE
.LP
The escape sequence \fB"\\ddd"\fP consists of backslash followed by
one, two, or three octal digits, which shall be taken to
specify the value of the desired character. If the character following
a backslash is not one of those specified, the backslash
shall be ignored.
.LP
Backslash ( \fB'\\'\fP ) followed by a <newline> is also used to continue
a string on the following line. Thus, the
following two lines describe a single message string:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB1 This line continues \\
to the next line
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
which shall be equivalent to:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB1 This line continues to the next line
\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values shall be returned:
.TP 7
\ 0
Successful completion.
.TP 7
>0
An error occurred.
.sp
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
Default.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
Message catalogs produced by \fIgencat\fP are binary encoded, meaning
that their portability cannot be guaranteed between
different types of machine. Thus, just as C programs need to be recompiled
for each type of machine, so message catalogs must be
recreated via \fIgencat\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
