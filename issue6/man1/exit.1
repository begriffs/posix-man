The \fIexit\fP utility shall cause the shell to exit with the exit
status specified by the unsigned decimal integer \fIn\fP.
If \fIn\fP is specified, but its value is not between 0 and 255 inclusively,
the exit status is undefined.
.LP
A \fItrap\fP on \fBEXIT\fP shall be executed before the shell terminates,
except when the

case the shell shall exit
immediately.
