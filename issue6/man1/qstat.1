.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The status of a batch job, batch queue, or batch server is obtained
by a request to the server. The \fIqstat\fP utility is a
user-accessible batch client that requests the status of one or more
batch jobs, batch queues, or servers, and writes the status
information to standard output.
.LP
For each successfully processed batch \fIjob_identifier\fP, the \fIqstat\fP
utility shall display information about the
corresponding batch job.
.LP
For each successfully processed destination, the \fIqstat\fP utility
shall display information about the corresponding batch
queue.
.LP
For each successfully processed server name, the \fIqstat\fP utility
shall display information about the corresponding
server.
.LP
The \fIqstat\fP utility shall acquire batch job status information
by sending a \fIJob Status Request\fP to a batch server.
The \fIqstat\fP utility shall acquire batch queue status information
by sending a \fIQueue Status Request\fP to a batch server.
The \fIqstat\fP utility shall acquire server status information by
sending a \fIServer Status Request\fP to a batch server.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fIqstat\fP utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
.LP
The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
.TP 7
\fB-f\fP
Specify that a full display is produced. 
.LP
The minimum contents of a full display are specified in the STDOUT
section.
.LP
Additional contents and format of a full display are implementation-defined.
.TP 7
\fB-Q\fP
Specify that the operand is a destination. 
.LP
The \fIqstat\fP utility shall display information about each batch
queue at each destination identified as an operand.
.TP 7
\fB-B\fP
Specify that the operand is a server name. 
.LP
The \fIqstat\fP utility shall display information about each server
identified as an operand.
.sp
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
If the \fB-Q\fP option is presented to the \fIqstat\fP utility, the
utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to
the syntax for a destination (see \fIDestination\fP ).
.LP
If the \fB-B\fP option is presented to the \fIqstat\fP utility, the
utility shall accept one or more \fIserver_name\fP
operands.
.LP
If neither the \fB-B\fP nor the \fB-Q\fP option is presented to the
\fIqstat\fP utility, the utility shall accept one or more
operands that conform to the syntax for a batch \fIjob_identifier\fP
(see \fIBatch Job
Identifier\fP ).
.SH STDIN
.LP
Not used.
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIqstat\fP:
.TP 7
\fIHOME\fP
Determine the pathname of the user's home directory.
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP 7
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_COLLATE\fP
.sp
Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges, equivalence classes,
and multi-character collating elements within regular
expressions.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
.TP 7
\fILC_NUMERIC\fP
.sp
Determine the locale for selecting the radix character used when writing
floating-point formatted output.

not be required to write a diagnostic message to standard
error when the error reply received from a batch server indicates
that the batch \fIjob_identifier\fP does not exist on the
server. Whether or not the \fIqstat\fP utility waits to output the
diagnostic message while attempting to locate the batch job on
other servers is implementation-defined.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fIqstat\fP utility allows users to display the status of jobs
and list the batch jobs in queues.
.LP
The operands of the \fIqstat\fP utility may be either job identifiers,
queues (specified as destination identifiers), or batch
server names. The \fB-Q\fP and \fB-B\fP options, or absence thereof,
indicate the nature of the operands.
.LP
The other options of the \fIqstat\fP utility allow the user to control
the amount of information displayed and the format in
which it is displayed. Should a user wish to display the status of
a set of jobs that match a selection criteria, the \fIqselect\fP utility
may be used to acquire such a list.
.LP
The \fB-f\fP option allows users to request a "full" display in an
implementation-defined format.
.LP
Historically, the \fIqstat\fP utility has been a part of the NQS and
its derivatives, the existing practice on which it is
based.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
