.LP
\fBcal\fP \fB[[\fP\fImonth\fP\fB]\fP \fIyear\fP \fB]\fP\fB\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIcal\fP utility shall write a calendar to standard output using
the Julian calendar for dates from January 1, 1 through
September 2, 1752 and the Gregorian calendar for dates from September
14, 1752 through December 31, 9999 as though the Gregorian
calendar had been adopted on September 14, 1752.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
None.
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operands shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fImonth\fP
Specify the month to be displayed, represented as a decimal integer
from 1 (January) to 12 (December). The default shall be the
current month.
.TP 7
\fIyear\fP
Specify the year for which the calendar is displayed, represented
as a decimal integer from 1 to 9999. The default shall be the
current year.

Not used.
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIcal\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP 7
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error,
and informative messages written to standard output.
.TP 7
\fILC_TIME\fP
Determine the format and contents of the calendar.
.TP 7
\fINLSPATH\fP
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of \fILC_MESSAGES
\&.\fP
.TP 7
\fITZ\fP
Determine the timezone used to calculate the value of the current
