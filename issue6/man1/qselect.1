.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
To select a set of batch jobs is to return the batch \fIjob_identifier\fPs
for each batch job that meets a list of selection
criteria. A set of batch jobs is selected by a request to a batch
server. The \fIqselect\fP utility is a user-accessible batch
client that requests the selection of batch jobs.
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIqselect\fP utility shall have returned
a list of zero or more batch \fIjob_identifier\fPs
that meet the criteria specified by the options and option-arguments
presented to the utility.
.LP
The \fIqselect\fP utility shall select batch jobs by sending a \fISelect
Jobs Request\fP to a batch server. The \fIqselect\fP
utility shall not exit until the server replies to each request generated.
.LP
For each option presented to the \fIqselect\fP utility, the utility
shall restrict the set of selected batch jobs as described
in the OPTIONS section.
.LP
The \fIqselect\fP utility shall not restrict selection of batch jobs
except by authorization and as required by the options
presented to the utility.
.LP
When an option is specified with a mandatory or optional \fIop\fP
component to the option-argument, then \fIop\fP shall
specify a relation between the value of a certain batch job attribute
and the \fIvalue\fP component of the option-argument. If an
\fIop\fP is allowable on an option, then the description of the option
letter indicates the \fIop\fP as either mandatory or
optional. Acceptable strings for the \fIop\fP component, and the relation
the string indicates, are shown in the following
list:
.TP 7
\fB\&.eq.\fP
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is equal to
the value represented by the option-argument.
.TP 7
\fB\&.ge.\fP
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is greater
than or equal to the value represented by the
option-argument.
.TP 7
\fB\&.gt.\fP
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is greater
than the value represented by the option-argument.
.TP 7
\fB\&.lt.\fP
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is less than
the value represented by the option-argument.
.TP 7
\fB\&.le.\fP
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is less than
or equal to the value represented by the
option-argument.
.TP 7
\fB\&.ne.\fP
The value represented by the attribute of the batch job is not equal
to the value represented by the option-argument.

The \fIqselect\fP utility shall select only batch jobs for which the
values of the \fIresource_name\fPs listed in the
\fIresource_list\fP option-argument match the corresponding limits
of the \fIResource_List\fP attribute of the batch job.
.LP
Limits of \fIresource_name\fPs present in the \fIResource_List\fP

The \fIqselect\fP utility shall select only batch jobs for which the
value of the \fIJob_Name\fP attribute matches the value

If the option-argument describes only a batch queue, the \fIqselect\fP

.RE
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fIqselect\fP utility allows users to acquire a list of job identifiers
that match user-specified selection criteria. The
list of identifiers returned by the \fIqselect\fP utility conforms
to the syntax of the batch job identifier list processed by a
utility such as \fIqmove\fP, \fIqdel\fP, and \fIqrls\fP. The \fIqselect\fP
utility is thus a powerful tool for causing another batch system
utility to act upon a set of jobs that match a list of selection criteria.
.LP
The options of the \fIqselect\fP utility let the user apply a number
of useful filters for selecting jobs. Each option further
restricts the selection of jobs. Many of the selection options allow
the specification of a relational operator. The FORTRAN-like
syntax of the operator-that is, \fB".lt."\fP - was chosen rather than
the C-like \fB"<="\fP meta-characters.
.LP
The \fB-a\fP option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to
those that have been submitted (or altered) to wait until a
particular time. The time period is determined by the argument of
this option, which includes both a time and an operator-it is
thus possible to select jobs waiting until a specific time, jobs waiting
until after a certain time, or those waiting for a time
before the specified time.
.LP
The \fB-A\fP option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to
those that have been submitted (or altered) to charge a
particular account.
.LP
The \fB-c\fP option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to
those whose checkpointing interval falls within the specified
range.
.LP
The \fB-l\fP option allows users to select those jobs whose resource
limits fall within the range indicated by the value of the
option. For example, a user could select those jobs for which the
CPU time limit is greater than two hours.
.LP
The \fB-N\fP option allows users to select jobs by job name. For instance,
all the parts of a task that have been divided in
parallel jobs might be given the same name, and thus manipulated as
a group by means of this option.
.LP
The \fB-q\fP option allows users to select jobs in a specified queue.
.LP
The \fB-r\fP option allows users to select only those jobs with a
specified rerun criteria. For instance, a user might select
only those jobs that can be rerun for use with the \fIqrerun\fP utility.
.LP
The \fB-s\fP option allows users to select only those jobs that are
in a certain state.
.LP
The \fB-u\fP option allows users to select jobs that have been submitted
to execute under a particular account.
.LP
The selection criteria provided by the options of the \fIqselect\fP
utility allow users to select jobs based on all the
appropriate attributes that can be assigned to jobs by the \fIqsub\fP
utility.
.LP
Historically, the \fIqselect\fP utility has not been a part of existing
practice; it is an improvement that has been introduced
in this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001.
