.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
To submit a script is to create a batch job that executes the script.
A script is submitted by a request to a batch server. The
\fIqsub\fP utility is a user-accessible batch client that submits
a script.

The \fIqsub\fP utility shall place the value of the following environment
variables in the \fIVariable_List\fP attribute of
the batch job: \fIHOME\fP,  \fILANG\fP,  \fILOGNAME\fP,  \fIPATH\fP, 
\fIMAIL\fP,  \fISHELL\fP,  and \fITZ\fP.  The name of
the environment variable shall be the current name prefixed with the
string PBS_O_. 
.TP 7
\fBNote:\fP
If the current value of the \fIHOME\fP variable in the environment
space of the \fIqsub\fP utility is \fB/aa/bb/cc\fP, then
\fIqsub\fP shall place \fIPBS_O_HOME =\fP \fB/aa/bb/cc\fP in the \fIVariable_List\fP
attribute of the batch job.
.sp
.LP

the path to the script of the batch job.
.LP
If the \fIscript\fP operand is not presented to the \fIqsub\fP utility,
or if the operand is the single-character string
\fB'-'\fP, the utility shall read the script from standard input.
.LP

input if the script operand is omitted or is the single
character \fB'-'\fP .
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
In addition to binding the file indicated by the \fIscript\fP operand
to the batch job, the \fIqsub\fP utility reads the
script file and acts on directives in the script.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIqsub\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for

.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP
Once created, a batch job exists until it exits, aborts, or is deleted.
.LP
After a batch job is created by the \fIqsub\fP utility, batch servers
might route, execute, modify, or delete the batch
job.
.SH STDOUT
.LP
The \fIqsub\fP utility writes the batch \fIjob_identifier\fP assigned
to the batch job to standard output, unless the
\fB-z\fP option is specified.
.SH STDERR
.LP
The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
.SH OUTPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.SS Script Preservation
.LP
The \fIqsub\fP utility shall make the script available to the server
executing the batch job in such a way that the server
executes the script as it exists at the time of submission.
.LP
The \fIqsub\fP utility can send a copy of the script to the server
with the \fIQueue Job Request\fP or store a temporary copy
of the script in a location specified to the server.
.SS Option Specification
.LP
A script can contain directives to the \fIqsub\fP utility.
.LP
The \fIqsub\fP utility shall scan the lines of the script for directives,
skipping blank lines, until the first line that
begins with a string other than the directive string; if directives
occur on subsequent lines, the utility shall ignore those
directives.
.LP
Lines are separated by a <newline>. If the first line of the script
begins with \fB"#!"\fP or a colon ( \fB':'\fP ),
then it is skipped. The \fIqsub\fP utility shall process a line in
the script as a directive if and only if the string of
characters from the first non-white-space character on the line until
the first <space> or <tab> on the line match the
directive prefix. If a line in the script contains a directive and
the final characters of the line are backslash ( \fB'\\'\fP )
and <newline>, then the next line shall be interpreted as a continuation
of that directive.
.LP
The \fIqsub\fP utility shall process the options and option-arguments
contained on the directive prefix line using the same
syntax as if the options were input on the \fIqsub\fP utility.
.LP
The \fIqsub\fP utility shall continue to process a directive prefix
line until after a <newline> is encountered. An
implementation may ignore lines which, according to the syntax of
the shell that will interpret the script, are comments. An
implementation shall describe in the conformance document the format
of any shell comments that it will recognize.
.LP
If an option is present in both a directive and the arguments to the
\fIqsub\fP utility, the utility shall ignore the option
and the corresponding option-argument, if any, in the directive.
.LP
If an option that is present in the directive is not present in the
arguments to the \fIqsub\fP utility, the utility shall
process the option and the option-argument, if any.
.LP
In order of preference, the \fIqsub\fP utility shall select the directive
prefix from one of the following sources:
.IP " *" 3
If the \fB-C\fP option is presented to the utility, the value of the
\fIdirective_prefix\fP option-argument
.LP
.IP " *" 3
If the environment variable \fIPBS_DPREFIX\fP is defined, the value
of that variable
.LP
.IP " *" 3
The four-character string \fB"#PBS"\fP encoded in the portable character
set
.LP
.LP
If the \fB-C\fP option is present in the script file it shall be ignored.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values shall be returned:
.TP 7
\ 0
Successful completion.
.TP 7
>0
An error occurred.
.sp
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
Default.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
None.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fIqsub\fP utility allows users to create a batch job that will
process the script specified as the operand of the
utility.
.LP
The options of the \fIqsub\fP utility allow users to control many
aspects of the queuing and execution of a batch job.
.LP
The \fB-a\fP option allows users to designate the time after which
the batch job will become eligible to run. By specifying an
execution time, users can take advantage of resources at off-peak
hours, synchronize jobs with chronologically predictable events,
and perhaps take advantage of off-peak pricing of computing time.
For these reasons and others, a timing option is existing
practice on the part of almost every batch system, including NQS.
.LP
The \fB-A\fP option allows users to specify the account that will
be charged for the batch job. Support for account is not
mandatory for conforming batch servers.
.LP
The \fB-C\fP option allows users to prescribe the prefix for directives
within the script file. The default prefix
\fB"#PBS"\fP may be inappropriate if the script will be interpreted
with an alternate shell, as specified by the \fB-S\fP
option.
.LP
The \fB-c\fP option allows users to establish the checkpointing interval
for their jobs. A checkpointing system, which is not
defined by this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, allows recovery
of a batch job at the most recent checkpoint in the event
of a crash. Checkpointing is typically used for jobs that consume
expensive computing time or must meet a critical schedule. Users
should be allowed to make the tradeoff between the overhead of checkpointing
and the risk to the timely completion of the batch
job; therefore, this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 provides the
checkpointing interval option. Support for checkpointing
is optional for batch servers.
.LP
The \fB-e\fP option allows users to redirect the standard error streams
of their jobs to a non-default path. For example, if
the submitted script generally produces a great deal of useless error
output, a user might redirect the standard error output to
the null device. Or, if the file system holding the default location
(the home directory of the user) has too little free space,
the user might redirect the standard error stream to a file in another
file system.
.LP
The \fB-h\fP option allows users to create a batch job that is held
until explicitly released. The ability to create a held job
is useful when some external event must complete before the batch
job can execute. For example, the user might submit a held job
and release it when the system load has dropped.
.LP
The \fB-j\fP option allows users to merge the standard error of a
batch job into its standard output stream, which has the
advantage of showing the sequential relationship between output and
error messages.
.LP
The \fB-m\fP option allows users to designate those points in the
execution of a batch job at which mail will be sent to the
submitting user, or to the account(s) indicated by the \fB-M\fP option.
By requesting mail notification at points of interest in
the life of a job, the submitting user, or other designated users,
can track the progress of a batch job.
.LP
The \fB-N\fP option allows users to associate a name with the batch
job. The job name in no way affects the processing of the
batch job, but rather serves as a mnemonic handle for users. For example,
the batch job name can help the user distinguish between
multiple jobs listed by the \fIqstat\fP utility.
.LP
The \fB-o\fP option allows users to redirect the standard output stream.
A user might, for example, wish to redirect to the
null device the standard output stream of a job that produces copious
yet superfluous output.
.LP
The \fB-P\fP option allows users to designate the relative priority
of a batch job for selection from a queue.
.LP
The \fB-q\fP option allows users to specify an initial queue for the
batch job. If the user specifies a routing queue, the
batch server routes the batch job to another queue for execution or
further routing. If the user specifies a non-routing queue, the
batch server of the queue eventually executes the batch job.
.LP
The \fB-r\fP option allows users to control whether the submitted
job will be rerun if the controlling batch node fails during
execution of the batch job. The \fB-r\fP option likewise allows users
to indicate whether or not the batch job is eligible to be
rerun by the \fIqrerun\fP utility. Some jobs cannot be correctly rerun
because of changes
they make in the state of databases or other aspects of their environment.
This volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 specifies
that the default, if the \fB-r\fP option is not presented to the utility,
will be that the batch job cannot be rerun, since the
result of rerunning a non-rerunnable job might be catastrophic.
.LP
The \fB-S\fP option allows users to specify the program (usually a
shell) that will be invoked to process the script of the
batch job. This option has been modified to allow a list of shell
names and locations associated with different hosts.
.LP
The \fB-u\fP option is useful when the submitting user is authorized
to use more than one account on a given host, in which
case the \fB-u\fP option allows the user to select from among those
accounts. The option-argument is a list of user-host pairs, so
that the submitting user can provide different user identifiers for
different nodes in the event the batch job is routed. The
\fB-u\fP option provides a lot of flexibility to accommodate sites
with complex account structures. Users that have the same user
identifier on all the hosts they are authorized to use will not need
to use the \fB-u\fP option.
.LP
The \fB-V\fP option allows users to export all their current environment
variables, as of the time the batch job is submitted,
to the context of the processes of the batch job.
.LP
The \fB-v\fP option allows users to export specific environment variables
from their current process to the processes of the
batch job.
.LP
The \fB-z\fP option allows users to suppress the writing of the batch
job identifier to standard output. The \fB-z\fP option
is an existing NQS practice that has been standardized.
.LP
Historically, the \fIqsub\fP utility has served the batch job-submission
function in the NQS system, the existing practice on
which it is based. Some changes and additions have been made to the
\fIqsub\fP utility in this volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, \fIvis-a-vis\fP NQS, as a result of the growing
pool of experience with distributed batch
systems.
.LP
The set of features of the \fIqsub\fP utility as defined in this volume
of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 appears to
incorporate all the common existing practice on potentially conforming
platforms.
