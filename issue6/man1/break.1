.SH NAME
break \- exit from for, while, or until loop
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBbreak\fP \fB[\fP\fIn\fP\fB]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIbreak\fP utility shall exit from the smallest enclosing \fBfor\fP,
\fBwhile\fP, or \fBuntil\fP loop, if any; or from
the \fIn\fPth enclosing loop if \fIn\fP is specified. The value of
\fIn\fP is an unsigned decimal integer greater than or equal
to 1. The default shall be equivalent to \fIn\fP=1. If \fIn\fP is
greater than the number of enclosing loops, the outermost
enclosing loop shall be exited. Execution shall continue with the
command immediately following the loop.

.LP
In early proposals, consideration was given to expanding the syntax
of \fIbreak\fP and \fIcontinue\fP to refer to a label associated with
the appropriate loop as a preferable
alternative to the \fIn\fP method. However, this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001
does reserve the name space of command
names ending with a colon. It is anticipated that a future implementation
could take advantage of this and provide something
like:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBoutofloop: for i in a b c d e
do
    for j in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    do
        if test -r "${i}${j}"
        then break outofloop
        fi
    done
done
\fP
.fi

.LP
and that this might be standardized after implementation experience
is achieved.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
