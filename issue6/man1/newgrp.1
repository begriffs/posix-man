newgrp \- change to a new group
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBnewgrp\fP \fB[\fP\fB-l\fP\fB][\fP\fIgroup\fP\fB]\fP\fB\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fInewgrp\fP utility shall create a new shell execution environment
with a new real and effective group identification. Of
the attributes listed in \fIShell Execution Environment\fP, the new
shell execution
environment shall retain the working directory, file creation mask,
and exported variables from the previous environment (that is,
open files, traps, unexported variables, alias definitions, shell
functions, and \fIset\fP options may be lost). All other aspects of
the process environment that are
preserved by the \fIexec\fP family of functions defined in the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 shall
also be preserved by \fInewgrp\fP; whether other aspects are preserved
is unspecified.
.LP
A failure to assign the new group identifications (for example, for
security or password-related reasons) shall not prevent the
new shell execution environment from being created.
.LP
The \fInewgrp\fP utility shall affect the supplemental groups for
the process as follows:
.IP " *" 3
On systems where the effective group ID is normally in the supplementary
group list (or whenever the old effective group ID
actually is in the supplementary group list):
.RS
.IP " *" 3
If the new effective group ID is also in the supplementary group list,
\fInewgrp\fP shall change the effective group ID.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
If the new effective group ID is not in the supplementary group list,
\fInewgrp\fP shall add the new effective group ID to the
list, if there is room to add it.

.IP " *" 3
On systems where the effective group ID is not normally in the supplementary
group list (or whenever the old effective group ID
is not in the supplementary group list):
.RS
.IP " *" 3
If the new effective group ID is in the supplementary group list,
\fInewgrp\fP shall delete it.
.LP

If the old effective group ID is not in the supplementary list, \fInewgrp\fP
shall add it if there is room.

\fBNote:\fP
The System Interfaces volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 does not specify
whether the effective group ID of a process is
included in its supplementary group list.
.sp
.LP
With no operands, \fInewgrp\fP shall change the effective group back
to the groups identified in the user's user entry, and
shall set the list of supplementary groups to that set in the user's
group database entries.
.LP
If a password is required for the specified group, and the user is
not listed as a member of that group in the group database,
the user shall be prompted to enter the correct password for that
group. If the user is listed as a member of that group, no
password shall be requested. If no password is required for the specified
group, it is implementation-defined whether users not
listed as members of that group can change to that group. Whether
or not a password is required, implementation-defined system
accounting or security mechanisms may impose additional authorization
restrictions that may cause \fInewgrp\fP to write a
diagnostic message and suppress the changing of the group identification.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fInewgrp\fP utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
.LP
The following option shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fB-l\fP
(The letter ell.) Change the environment to what would be expected
if the user actually logged in again.
.sp
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operand shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fIgroup\fP
A group name from the group database or a non-negative numeric group
ID. Specifies the group ID to which the real and effective
group IDs shall be set. If \fIgroup\fP is a non-negative numeric string
and exists in the group database as a group name (see \fIgetgrnam\fP()),
the numeric group ID associated with that group name shall be used
as the
group ID.
.sp
.SH STDIN
.LP
Not used.
.SH INPUT FILES
.LP
The file \fB/dev/tty\fP shall be used to read a single line of text
for password checking, when one is required.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.LP
The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fInewgrp\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
for
the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine
the values of locale categories.)
.TP 7
\fILC_ALL\fP
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
error.
.TP 7
\fINLSPATH\fP
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of \fILC_MESSAGES
\&.\fP 
.sp
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP
Default.
.SH STDOUT
.LP
Not used.
.SH STDERR
.LP
The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and a prompt
string for a password, if one is required. Diagnostic
messages may be written in cases where the exit status is not available.
See the EXIT STATUS section.
.SH OUTPUT FILES
.LP
None.
.SH EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.LP
None.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
If \fInewgrp\fP succeeds in creating a new shell execution environment,
whether or not the group identification was changed
successfully, the exit status shall be the exit status of the shell.
Otherwise, the following exit value shall be returned:
.TP 7
>0
An error occurred.
.sp
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
The invoking shell may terminate.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
There is no convenient way to enter a password into the group database.
Use of group passwords is not encouraged, because by
their very nature they encourage poor security practices. Group passwords
may disappear in the future.
.LP
A common implementation of \fInewgrp\fP is that the current shell
uses \fIexec\fP to overlay itself with \fInewgrp\fP, which
in turn overlays itself with a new shell after changing group. On
some implementations, however, this may not occur and
\fInewgrp\fP may be invoked as a subprocess.
.LP
The \fInewgrp\fP command is intended only for use from an interactive
terminal. It does not offer a useful interface for the
support of applications.
.LP
The exit status of \fInewgrp\fP is generally inapplicable. If \fInewgrp\fP
is used in a script, in most cases it successfully
invokes a new shell and the rest of the original shell script is bypassed
when the new shell exits. Used interactively,
\fInewgrp\fP displays diagnostic messages to indicate problems. But
usage such as:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBnewgrp foo
echo $?
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
is not useful because the new shell might not have access to any status
\fInewgrp\fP may have generated (and most historical
systems do not provide this status). A zero status echoed here does
not necessarily indicate that the user has changed to the new
group successfully. Following \fInewgrp\fP with the \fIid\fP command
provides a portable means
of determining whether the group change was successful or not.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Most historical implementations use one of the \fIexec\fP functions
to implement the behavior of \fInewgrp\fP. Errors detected
before the \fIexec\fP leave the environment unchanged, while errors
detected after the \fIexec\fP leave the user in a changed
environment. While it would be useful to have \fInewgrp\fP issue a
diagnostic message to tell the user that the environment
changed, it would be inappropriate to require this change to some
historical implementations.
.LP
The password mechanism is allowed in the group database, but how this
would be implemented is not specified.
.LP
The \fInewgrp\fP utility was retained in this volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001,
even given the existence of the
multiple group permissions feature in the System Interfaces volume
of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, for several reasons. First,
in some implementations, the group ownership of a newly created file
is determined by the group of the directory in which the file
is created, as allowed by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001;
on other implementations, the group
ownership of a newly created file is determined by the effective group
ID. On implementations of the latter type, \fInewgrp\fP
allows files to be created with a specific group ownership. Finally,
many implementations use the real group ID in accounting, and
on such systems, \fInewgrp\fP allows the accounting identity of the
user to be changed.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
