.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIat\fP utility shall read commands from standard input and group
them together as an \fIat-job\fP, to be executed at a
later time.
.LP
The at-job shall be executed in a separate invocation of the shell,
running in a separate process group with no controlling
terminal, except that the environment variables, current working directory,
file creation mask, and other implementation-defined
execution-time attributes in effect when the \fIat\fP utility is executed
shall be retained and used when the at-job is
executed.
.LP
When the at-job is submitted, the \fIat_job_id\fP and scheduled time
shall be written to standard error. The \fIat_job_id\fP
is an identifier that shall be a string consisting solely of alphanumeric
characters and the period character. The \fIat_job_id\fP
shall be assigned by the system when the job is scheduled such that
it uniquely identifies a particular job.
.LP
User notification and the processing of the job's standard output
and standard error are described under the \fB-m\fP
option.
.LP
Users shall be permitted to use \fIat\fP if their name appears in
the file \fB/usr/lib/cron/at.allow\fP. If that file does not
exist, the file \fB/usr/lib/cron/at.deny\fP shall be checked to determine
whether the user shall be denied access to \fIat\fP. If
neither file exists, only a process with the appropriate privileges
shall be allowed to submit a job. If only \fBat.deny\fP exists
and is empty, global usage shall be permitted. The \fBat.allow\fP
and \fBat.deny\fP files shall consist of one user name per
line. 
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The \fIat\fP utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
.LP
The following options shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fB-f\ \fP \fIfile\fP
Specify the pathname of a file to be used as the source of the at-job,
instead of standard input.
.TP 7
\fB-l\fP
(The letter ell.) Report all jobs scheduled for the invoking user
if no \fIat_job_id\fP operands are specified. If
\fIat_job_id\fPs are specified, report only information for these
jobs. The output shall be written to standard output.
.TP 7
\fB-m\fP
Send mail to the invoking user after the at-job has run, announcing
its completion. Standard output and standard error produced
by the at-job shall be mailed to the user as well, unless redirected
elsewhere. Mail shall be sent even if the job produces no
output. 
.LP
If \fB-m\fP is not used, the job's standard output and standard error
shall be provided to the user by means of mail, unless
they are redirected elsewhere; if there is no such output to provide,
the implementation need not notify the user of the job's
completion.
.TP 7
\fB-q\ \fP \fIqueuename\fP
.sp
Specify in which queue to schedule a job for submission. When used
with the \fB-l\fP option, limit the search to that particular
queue. By default, at-jobs shall be scheduled in queue \fIa\fP. In
contrast, queue \fIb\fP shall be reserved for batch jobs; see
\fIbatch\fP. The meanings of all other \fIqueuename\fPs are implementation-defined.
If
\fB-q\fP is specified along with either of the \fB-t\fP \fItime_arg\fP
or \fItimespec\fP arguments, the results are
unspecified.
.TP 7
\fB-r\fP
Remove the jobs with the specified \fIat_job_id\fP operands that were
previously scheduled by the \fIat\fP utility.
.TP 7
\fB-t\ \fP \fItime_arg\fP
Submit the job to be run at the time specified by the \fItime\fP option-argument,
which the application shall ensure has the
format as specified by the \fItouch\fP \fB-t\fP \fItime\fP utility.
.sp
.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operands shall be supported:
.TP 7
\fIat_job_id\fP
The name reported by a previous invocation of the \fIat\fP utility
at the time the job was scheduled.
.TP 7
\fItimespec\fP
Submit the job to be run at the date and time specified. All of the
\fItimespec\fP operands are interpreted as if they were
separated by <space>s and concatenated, and shall be parsed as described
in the grammar at the end of this section. The date
and time shall be interpreted as being in the timezone of the user
(as determined by the \fITZ\fP variable), unless a timezone
name appears as part of \fItime\fP, below. 
.LP
In the POSIX locale, the following describes the three parts of the
time specification string. All of the values from the
\fILC_TIME\fP categories in the POSIX locale shall be recognized in
a case-insensitive manner.
.TP 7
\fItime\fP
.RS
The time can be specified as one, two, or four digits. One-digit and
two-digit numbers shall be taken to be hours; four-digit
numbers to be hours and minutes. The time can alternatively be specified
as two numbers separated by a colon, meaning
\fIhour\fP:\fIminute\fP. An AM/PM indication (one of the values from
the \fBam_pm\fP keywords in the \fILC_TIME\fP locale
category) can follow the time; otherwise, a 24-hour clock time shall
be understood. A timezone name can also follow to further
qualify the time. The acceptable timezone names are implementation-defined,
except that they shall be case-insensitive and the
string \fButc\fP is supported to indicate the time is in Coordinated
Universal Time. In the POSIX locale, the \fItime\fP field
can also be one of the following tokens: 
.TP 7
\fBmidnight\fP
.RS
Indicates the time 12:00 am (00:00).
.RE
.TP 7
\fBnoon\fP
.RS
Indicates the time 12:00 pm.
.RE
.TP 7
\fBnow\fP
.RS
Indicates the current day and time. Invoking \fIat\fP <\fBnow\fP>
shall submit an at-job for potentially immediate
execution (that is, subject only to unspecified scheduling delays).
.RE
.sp
.RE
.TP 7
\fIdate\fP
.RS
An optional \fIdate\fP can be specified as either a month name (one
of the values from the \fBmon\fP or \fBabmon\fP keywords
in the \fILC_TIME\fP locale category) followed by a day number (and
possibly year number preceded by a comma), or a day of the
week (one of the values from the \fBday\fP or \fBabday\fP keywords
in the \fILC_TIME\fP locale category). In the POSIX locale,
two special days shall be recognized: 
.TP 7
\fBtoday\fP
.RS
Indicates the current day.
.RE
.TP 7
\fBtomorrow\fP
.RS
Indicates the day following the current day.
.RE
.sp
.LP
If no \fIdate\fP is given, \fBtoday\fP shall be assumed if the given
time is greater than the current time, and
\fBtomorrow\fP shall be assumed if it is less. If the given month
is less than the current month (and no year is given), next year
shall be assumed.
.RE
.TP 7
\fIincrement\fP
.RS
The optional \fIincrement\fP shall be a number preceded by a plus
sign ( \fB'+'\fP ) and suffixed by one of the following:
\fBminutes\fP, \fBhours\fP, \fBdays\fP, \fBweeks\fP, \fBmonths\fP,
or \fByears\fP. (The singular forms shall also be
accepted.) The keyword \fBnext\fP shall be equivalent to an increment
number of +1. For example, the following are equivalent
commands: 
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBat 2pm + 1 week
at 2pm next week
\fP
.fi

.LP
The following grammar describes the precise format of \fItimespec\fP
in the POSIX locale. The general conventions for this
style of grammar are described in \fIGrammar Conventions\fP . This
formal syntax shall
take precedence over the preceding text syntax description. The longest
possible token or delimiter shall be recognized at a given
point. When used in a \fItimespec\fP, white space shall also delimit
tokens.

The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
\fIat\fP:
.TP 7
\fILANG\fP
Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that
are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables

If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the
other internationalization variables.
.TP 7
\fILC_CTYPE\fP
Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes
of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).
.TP 7
\fILC_MESSAGES\fP
Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and
contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error and
informative messages written to standard output.
.TP 7
\fINLSPATH\fP
Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of \fILC_MESSAGES
\&.\fP 
.TP 7
\fILC_TIME\fP
Determine the format and contents for date and time strings written
and accepted by \fIat\fP.
.TP 7
\fISHELL\fP
Determine a name of a command interpreter to be used to invoke the
at-job. If the variable is unset or null, \fIsh\fP shall be used.
If it is set to a value other than a name for \fIsh\fP, the implementation
shall do one of the following: use that shell; use \fIsh\fP; use the
login shell from the user database; or any of the preceding accompanied
by a warning
diagnostic about which was chosen.

\fITZ\fP
Determine the timezone. The job shall be submitted for execution at
the time specified by \fItimespec\fP or \fB-t\fP
\fItime\fP relative to the timezone specified by the \fITZ\fP variable.
If \fItimespec\fP specifies a timezone, it shall

and \fITZ\fP is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone
shall be used.
.sp
.SH ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.LP

In the POSIX locale, the following shall be written to the standard
output for each job when jobs are listed in response to the
\fB-l\fP option:
.sp

.sp
.SH CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.LP
The job shall not be scheduled, removed, or listed.
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The format of the \fIat\fP command line shown here is guaranteed only
for the POSIX locale. Other cultures may be supported
with substantially different interfaces, although implementations
are encouraged to provide comparable levels of functionality.
.LP
Since the commands run in a separate shell invocation, running in
a separate process group with no controlling terminal, open
file descriptors, traps, and priority inherited from the invoking
environment are lost.
.LP
Some implementations do not allow substitution of different shells
using \fISHELL\fP.  System V systems, for example, have used
the login shell value for the user in \fB/etc/passwd\fP. To select
reliably another command interpreter, the user must include it
as part of the script, such as:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB$\fP \fBat 1800
myshell myscript
EOT
\fP\fBjob ... at ...
$\fP
.fi
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP " 1." 4
This sequence can be used at a terminal:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBat -m 0730 tomorrow
sort < file >outfile
EOT
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
.IP " 2." 4
This sequence, which demonstrates redirecting standard error to a
pipe, is useful in a command procedure (the sequence of output
redirection specifications is significant):
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBat now + 1 hour <<!
diff file1 file2 2>&1 >outfile | mailx mygroup
!
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
.IP " 3." 4
To have a job reschedule itself, \fIat\fP can be invoked from within
the at-job. For example, this daily processing script
named \fBmy.daily\fP runs every day (although \fIcrontab\fP is a more
appropriate vehicle
for such work):
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fB# my.daily runs every day
\fP\fIdaily processing\fP\fBat now tomorrow < my.daily
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
.IP " 4." 4
The spacing of the three portions of the POSIX locale \fItimespec\fP
is quite flexible as long as there are no ambiguities.

.RE
.LP
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
The \fIat\fP utility reads from standard input the commands to be
executed at a later time. It may be useful to redirect
standard output and standard error within the specified commands.
.LP
The \fB-t\fP \fItime\fP option was added as a new capability to support
an internationalized way of specifying a time for
execution of the submitted job.
.LP
Early proposals added a "jobname" concept as a way of giving submitted
jobs names that are meaningful to the user submitting
them. The historical, system-specified \fIat_job_id\fP gives no indication
of what the job is. Upon further reflection, it was
decided that the benefit of this was not worth the change in historical
interface. The \fIat\fP functionality is useful in simple
environments, but in large or complex situations, the functionality
provided by the Batch Services option is more suitable.
.LP
The \fB-q\fP option historically has been an undocumented option,
used mainly by the \fIbatch\fP utility.
.LP
The System V \fB-m\fP option was added to provide a method for informing
users that an at-job had completed. Otherwise, users
are only informed when output to standard error or standard output
are not redirected.
.LP
The behavior of \fIat\fP <\fBnow\fP> was changed in an early proposal
from being unspecified to submitting a job for
potentially immediate execution. Historical BSD \fIat\fP implementations
support this. Historical System V implementations give an
error in that case, but a change to the System V versions should have
no backwards-compatibility ramifications.
.LP
On BSD-based systems, a \fB-u\fP \fIuser\fP option has allowed those
with appropriate privileges to access the work of other
users. Since this is primarily a system administration feature and
is not universally implemented, it has been omitted. Similarly,
a specification for the output format for a user with appropriate
privileges viewing the queues of other users has been
omitted.
.LP
The \fB-f\fP \fIfile\fP option from System V is used instead of the
BSD method of using the last operand as the pathname. The
BSD method is ambiguous-does:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBat 1200 friday
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
mean the same thing if there is a file named \fBfriday\fP in the current
directory?
.LP
The \fIat_job_id\fP is composed of a limited character set in historical
practice, and it is mandated here to invalidate
systems that might try using characters that require shell quoting
or that could not be easily parsed by shell scripts.
.LP
The \fIat\fP utility varies between System V and BSD systems in the
way timezones are used. On System V systems, the \fITZ\fP
variable affects the at-job submission times and the times displayed
for the user. On BSD systems, \fITZ\fP is not taken into
account. The BSD behavior is easily achieved with the current specification.
If the user wishes to have the timezone default to
that of the system, they merely need to issue the \fIat\fP command
immediately following an unsetting or null assignment to \fITZ
\&.\fP For example:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBTZ= at noon ...
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
gives the desired BSD result.
.LP
While the \fIyacc\fP-like grammar specified in the OPERANDS section
is lexically
unambiguous with respect to the digit strings, a lexical analyzer
would probably be written to look for and return digit strings in
those cases. The parser could then check whether the digit string
returned is a valid \fIday_number\fP, \fIyear_number\fP, and so
on, based on the context.
