These files came from a Debian package:
https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages/man-pages-posix/

Rename the .{n}p extensions to .{n}:

	for f in *.3p; do 
		mv -- "$f" "${f%.3p}.3"
	done

Patch out the Linux preamble:

	ls *.3 | xargs -I{} -L 1 patch {} remove-prolog.patch

where remove-prolog.patch is:

	4,8d3
	< .SH PROLOG
	< This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
	< The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult
	< the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
	< or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

Remove the "P" from section numbers internally:

	for f in *.3; do ex - "$f" << 'eof'; done
	%s/3P/3/
	%s/\.so man3p/.so man3/
	%s/\.3p/.3/
	x
	eof
